<h2>
PREFACE<a class="pagenum" name="page_v" title="v"> </a></h2>

<p>The writing of this little book has given
me a great deal of pleasure. That is why
I hope that, here and there, it may give
pleasure to others.</p>

<p>And yet it was not an easy task.
Nature's lessons are hard to learn. Harder
still is it to translate Nature's lessons to
others. Besides, the appeal of Nature is
to the Emotions; and words are weak
things (save in the hands of a great Poet)
by which to convey or to evoke emotion.
Words seem to be the vehicles rather of
ratiocination than of emotion. Is not
even the Poet driven to link words to
music? And always <i>le mot juste</i>, the
exact word, is so difficult to find! Yet
found it must be if the appeal is to avail.</p>

<hr />

<p>If, in these pages, there are scattered
speculations semi-mystical, semi-intelligible,
perhaps even transcending the boundaries
of rigid logic, I must simply aver
that I put in writing that only which was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_vi" title="vi"> </a>
given me to say. How or whence it came,
I do not know.&mdash;And this, notwithstanding
(or, perhaps, in a way, corroborative of)
my own belief that no thought is autogenous,
but has parents and a pedigree.</p>

<p>I have tried, quite humbly, to follow, as
motto, the sentence chosen from Spinoza.
Yet, with that sentence always should be
read this other, taken from Pascal: "<i>La
dernière démarche de la raison, c'est de
reconnaître qu'il y a une infinité de choses
qui la surpassent.</i>"&mdash;Always emotion,
imagination, feeling, faith, try to soar
above reason; and always they feel the
inadequacy of words.</p>

<p>I have incorporated in this book some
parts of my "Two Country Walks in
Canada"&mdash;now long out of print (itself
comprising an article from <i>The Nineteenth
Century</i> and another from <i>Blackwood's</i>);
also (with the permission of the editor) an
article in <i>The Atlantic Monthly Magazine</i>;
and Sections 22 and 23 first appeared in
<i>The Canadian Magazine</i>.</p>

<h2>
I<br/>
<span class="smcaps">Golf and Walking</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 1</h3>

<p>Many are the indictments which are
brought against Golf: that it is a deplorable
waster of time; that it depletes the
purse; that it divorces husband and
wife; that it delays the dinner-hour,
freckles fair feminine faces, upsets
domestic arrangements, and unhinges
generally the mental balance of its
devotees. Yet perhaps to each of such
charges Golf can enter a plea. It repays
expenditure of time and money with
<a class="pagenum" name="page_002" title="2"> </a>
interest in the form of health and good
spirits. If it acts the part of co-respondent
it is always open to the petitioner to
espouse the game. If it keeps men and
women away from work and home, at
least it keeps them out on the breezy
links and dispels for a time the cares of
the office or the kitchen. If it tans&mdash;well,
it tans, and a tanned face needs
no paint, and is, moreover, beautiful to
look upon. Nevertheless, one indictment
there is against which it is not in the
power of Golf to enter a plea. It has
killed the country walk. "A country
walk!" exclaimed a fellow-golfer to me
the other day. "I have not taken a
country walk since I began to play."</p>

<p>There are, I know, who affect to believe
that Golf consists of country walks,
diversified and embellished by pauses
made for the purpose of impelling little
<a class="pagenum" name="page_003" title="3"> </a>
round balls into little round holes; that
mind and eye are occupied chiefly with
the beauties of Nature, and that the
impulsion of the insignificant sphere into
the insignificant void is, as it were, but a
sop to Cerberus, or a cock sacrificed to the
Æsculapius of this sporting age. "How
greatly," said to me once a fair and innocent
stranger to my links&mdash;"how greatly
this beautiful landscape must enhance
the pleasure of your game!" <i>O sancta
simplicitas!</i> Far be it from me to explain
that as a rule the horrid golfer only drank
in the beauties of that landscape when the
game was over, and he was, perchance,
occupied in performing a similar operation
upon the contents of a tumbler at his
elbow as he reclined in an arm-chair on the
verandah.&mdash;And yet, and yet, our links
<i>are</i> beautiful, and one and all of us their
frequenters know and appreciate to the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_004" title="4"> </a>
full their beauty; but <i>not</i>, I think, at the
moment of "addressing the ball."&mdash;No;
Golf is Golf; a country walk is quite
another thing; and the one, I maintain,
has killed the other.</p>

<span class="smcaps">The Essence of a Walk</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 2</h3>

<p>For, mark you, the essence of a country
walk is that you shall have no object or
aim whatsoever. The frame of mind in
which one ought to set out upon a rural
peregrination should be one of absolute
mental vacuity. Almost one ought to
rid oneself, if so be that were possible,
even of the categories of time and place:
for to start with a determination to cover
a certain distance within a specified time
is to take, not a walk, but a "constitutional";
and of all abortions or monstrosities
of country walks, commend me
to the constitutional. The proper frame
<a class="pagenum" name="page_006" title="6"> </a>
of mind is that of absolute and secure
passivity; an openness to impressions;
a giving-up of ourselves to the great and
guiding influences of benignant Nature;
a humble receptivity of soul; a wondering
and childlike eagerness&mdash;not a restless
and too inquisitive eagerness&mdash;to learn all
that great Nature may like to teach, and
to learn it in the way that great Nature
would have us learn.</p>

<p>Yet, true, though we take with us a
vacuous mind, it must be a plenable mind
(if I may coin the word), a serenely
responsive mind; otherwise we shall not
reap the harvest of a quiet eye.</p>

of Nature's ways no one had a greater
right to sing. Wordsworth must have
<a class="pagenum" name="page_007" title="7"> </a>
been an ideal country walker. "The Excursion"
is the harvest of innumerable
walks, and when Wordsworth depicts the
Wanderer he depicts himself:</p>

    <div class="verse indent8">"In the woods</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Only, "the w . . . w . . . worst of
W . . . W . . . Wordsworth is," as a
stammering friend of mine once remarked,
"is, he is so d . . . d . . . d . . . desperate
p . . . pensive." (I was expecting
a past participle, not an ungrammatical
adverb for the "d.")&mdash;He is; and like,
yet unlike, Falstaff, he is not only pensive
in himself, but he is the cause of pensiveness
<a class="pagenum" name="page_008" title="8"> </a>
in other things&mdash;to wit, his "stars,"
his "citadels," and what not; and certainly
his diary of "A Tour in Scotland"
makes the driest reading I know.&mdash;Nevertheless,
Wordsworth must have been an
ideal country walker. He was</p>

<h3>
§ 3</h3>

<p>All great souls, I venture to think, were
at some period of their lives walkers in the
country. Jesus of Nazareth spent forty
days in the wilderness, and the three years
of his mission were, we know, spent in
unceasing wandering. And whose heart
does not burn within him as he reads the
moving narrative of that seven-mile
country walk which he took with two of
his disciples to the village called Emmaus?
It was after a forty days' solitary sojourn
on Mount Sinai, too, so we are told, that
Moses came down armed with the Decalogue;
and was it not after a similar
Ramadan retreat that Mohammed returned
<a class="pagenum" name="page_010" title="10"> </a>
with the novel doctrine that there
was no God but God? Enoch, we know,
walked with God; and it is a childish
fancy of mine which I am loath to relinquish
that God took him, and that he was
not, for because he was so delectable
a companion. Of a surety the Sweet
Singer of Israel must have wandered much
in the green pastures and by the still
waters; he who kept his father's sheep;
who slew both the lion and the bear; who
sang the high hills, a refuge for the wild
goats, and the rocks for the conies.&mdash;Indeed,
if one comes to think of it, how
much literature owes to the country walk!
It was to that long walk outside the wall
of Athens, and to the long talk that
Socrates held with Phædrus under the
plane-tree by the banks of the Ilissus,
that we owe one of the most beautiful of
the Dialogues of Plato. There had been
<a class="pagenum" name="page_011" title="11"> </a>
no Georgics had not Virgil loved the
country. Horace must as often have
circumambulated his Sabine farm as he
perambulated the Via Sacra. Chaucer
must sometimes have pilgrimed afoot,
and Spenser, trod as well as pricked
o'er the plain. Shakespeare's poaching
episode gives us a glimpse into his youthful
pursuits. Milton "oft the woods
among wooed Philomel to hear her evensong";
and even after his blindness
"not the more ceased he to wander where
the Muses haunt clear spring, or shady
grove, or sunny hill." "The Traveller"
of Goldsmith was the outcome of a walking
tour; so was Robert Louis Stevenson's
"Travels in the Cévennes with a Donkey".
To how many minds walks about the green
flat meads of Oxford have been a quiet
stimulant we may get a hint from more
than one of Matthew Arnold's poems.

<span class="smcaps">My Earliest Walks</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 4</h3>

<p>The earliest walks which my own memory
recalls were rather curious ones. We were
in Burma, a country in which, in the dry
season, exercise must be taken about
daybreak or sundown, or not at all.
We walked&mdash;and before breakfast; and
always we were accompanied by a pet cat,
a sharp-nosed "toddy-cat" (so they
called him), indigenous to the country,
and not unlike the American raccoon, very
affectionate and very cleanly. But the
cat was not our only companion, for just
overhead, screaming threateningly, were
always also, and all the way, a flock of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_016" title="16"> </a>
kites&mdash;the mortal enemies, so I must
suppose, of Hokey-Pokey (thus was named
our 'coon-cat pet).&mdash;Now I come to think
of it, it must have been a funny sight:
a family afoot; in the rear an impudent
cat with tail erect; overhead irate and
clamorous kites.</p>

<span class="smcaps">India</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 5</h3>

<p>My next walks were on the Nilgiris, the
Blue Mountains of India. Ah, they were
beautiful! The seven or eight thousand
feet of altitude tempered the tropical sun,
the mornings were fresh and invigorating&mdash;your
cold bath was really cold, and
spring seemed perennial. Hedges of
cluster-roses bloomed the whole year
round; on the orange-trees were leaf, bud,
bloom and ripening fruit, also the whole
year round. Heliotrope grew in gigantic
bushes that were pruned with garden
clippers. Through the grounds about
the house flowed a babbling brook, widening
<a class="pagenum" name="page_018" title="18"> </a>
here and there into quiet ponds, from
the sedgy edges of which green-stemmed
arums raised their graceful cups. In the
deep valleys grew the tree-fern; here
and there a playful waterfall gushed from
the hill; and everything was green.&mdash;No;
two things were not green: the one, the
hot and hazy plains, shimmering in yellow
dust as seen from the shoulder of a hill;
the other, the gigantic Droog, a mighty
mountain mass rearing its head, sombre
and silent, on the other side of a deep
ravine. The Droog was purple: not
with the pellucid purple of a petal, but
with the misty blue-black purple of the
bloom of a plum.&mdash;Ah, it was all very
good. Never shall I forget the convolvulus
that decorated the northern verandah
before the heat of day shrivelled the
delicate corollas. There were rich bass
purples that stirred one like the tones of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_019" title="19"> </a>
an organ. There were soprano pinks so
exquisite that a <i>pianissimo</i> trill on a violin
seemed crude in comparison. Their
beauty was all but audible: it penetrated
the senses and reached in to some inner
subtile psychic centre, there to move
emotions which must remain unsaid.&mdash;This
was in India.&mdash;There is something
perfervid in the fascination of the East.
The West may clutch the thrilled heart
with a steely clasp; the East holds the
soul in a passionate embrace.&mdash;Ah, India,
beloved India, my first nurse and I trust
my last; "not were that submarine, gem-lighted
city mine" would I relinquish
hope of seeing thee again, adored India:
old majestic land; land of ancient castes
and alien creeds; land of custom, myth,
and magic; land of pungent odours,
stinging tastes, and colours dazzling as the
sun; land of mystery, of pageant, and of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_020" title="20"> </a>
pain! Ah, subtile, thralling, luring India!&mdash;India
is like Samson's lion: it has been
conquered by the young and lusty Occident,
and in its old carcass its conqueror
finds both meat and sweetness;&mdash;and it
serves for a riddle to others. To complete
the analogy, there are those who are
trying to plough with Samson's heifer.</p>

<span class="smcaps">English Byways</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 6</h3>

<p>My next walks were in England. For
their size, the British Isles probably
afford the most varied tramping ground
of any country in the world. Within a
few hundred miles of radius you get
infinite variety: the rolling downs; the
quiet weald; hilly Derbyshire; mountainous
Wales; Devonshire's lanes; the
Westmorland or the Cumberland lakes&mdash;these
for the seeker of quiet. For the
more emprising there is the wild and
broken scenery of the northern isles;
and the lover of the homeless sea can
choose any shore to his liking.</p>


<h3>
§ 7<a class="pagenum" name="page_022" title="22"> </a></h3>

<p>There is an impression abroad that in
England you must confine your steps to
the high-road. That has not been my
experience. True, you must not expect
everywhere to be allowed to stalk anywhere
across country&mdash;unless you are
following the beagles; but, so numerous
are the byways and bridle-paths; so
easy has access been made, through
centuries of hereditary ownership, from
one field or stile or farm to another; so
generous, too, are so many landlords, that
one can travel for many and many a mile
without doing more than cross and recross
the road. But true it is also that, in order
to do this, you must know something of
the locality.</p>

<hr />

<p>One much-hidden entrance to a most
sequestered spot I hope I do no wrong in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_023" title="23"> </a>
revealing here.&mdash;London stretches out
north-west almost to Uxbridge, nearly
twenty miles out&mdash;that is, habitations
line almost every inch of the way. After
Uxbridge, the road is hard, dry, and
comparatively uninteresting. But, near
a cross-road, where is a house on either
side, if you look carefully to the right
you will dimly discern, beneath the shade
of low-bending boughs, and almost hidden
by these, a simple, unpretending stile.
I recommend you to climb over it, for it is
the entrance to a great, quiet, secluded
spot, several acres in extent, thickly
wooded with superb beeches and firs, so
thickly wooded that the sky is invisible
and the earth wholly in shade. But for
the extreme kemptness of the underbrush
(and the fact that you have just stepped
out of the London road), you might be in
a primæval forest of the West. Nor is
<a class="pagenum" name="page_024" title="24"> </a>
this the sum of its beauty. High though
it is above the surrounding country,
embosomed in this forest is a lovely lake,
exquisite in its colouring, reflecting, as
it does, the cloud-flecked sky, and, all
round its rim, the bending boughs of the
beech. Typical of England are this lake
and park. They are private property,
of course; but the owner gives every
wayfarer leave of access. Typical of
England: tenacious of rights, yet just,
nay, generous, to all.</p>

<p>"The little maid is laying the other half
of this table to supply me with eggs and
bacon....</p>

<p>"I got me out of Brighton early,
walked through Hassocks and Hurstpierpoint,
and strolled on in any direction that
invited (for I had the whole lovely day
<a class="pagenum" name="page_026" title="26"> </a>
to myself), choosing chiefly byways and
sequestered paths approached by stiles.</p>

<p>"The day was superb. The sky, after
a rainy night, was a rich deep blue, and
across it sailed great white-grey clouds,
the shadows of which chased each other&mdash;albeit
solemnly and with dignity&mdash;over
field and meadow. The fields, sown with
corn already tall, were burnished green&mdash;they
shone in the sunlight. The meadows
were deeper in colour. The slopes of the
downs changed their hues every moment;
every acre changed, according as it caught
the light direct, or through a thin cloud,
or was immersed in shade by a big and
thick one. The ditches and the little
banks by the road, out of which the trim
hedgerows sprang, were green with a
hundred little plants and weeds&mdash;the
dock, the nettle, groundsel, stick-a-bobs,
ivy of every hue and shape, mullein, the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_027" title="27"> </a>
alder well in leaf, and the hawthorn here
and there in flower.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Breakfast over. The most delicious
bacon, the freshest of eggs, milk that
might have masqueraded as cream; and
all served with the extremity of respectful
civility. A fire smouldering in the
hearth; a terrier longing to make friends;
otherwise they shut the door and leave me
to quiet privacy.</p>

<p>"The greenness of the hedges was
exquisite. And here and there the primroses
in profusion&mdash;and the violets&mdash;and
birds. England teems with life. I
heard the thrush&mdash;'It <i>is</i> Spring! It <i>is</i>
Spring! O the joy! I tell you it is&mdash;is&mdash;is!'
And the blackbirds screaming out
of a bush, pretending to be frightened,
but only looking for an excuse to shout.
The ring-doves, really disturbed and
rising with noisy wings. The rooks, lost
<a class="pagenum" name="page_028" title="28"> </a>
in real wonderment that anyone should
stop and look at them for five minutes,
and 'cawing' and 'cahing' in vociferous
interrogation. Querulous tits, chirping
hedge-sparrows, cheeping linnets and
finches&mdash;by the hundreds and hundreds."</p>

<hr />

<p>A mere peep (but a peep photographed
on the spot), and giving but a poor glimpse
of a scene the exact like of which you will
not get elsewhere the wide world over.&mdash;And,
by the way, shouldst ever find thyself

omit not to examine the Early Perpendicular
church;&mdash;the alms-box is an

<span class="smcaps">Autumn Reveries</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 9</h3>

<p>This was in the spring. Autumn in
England is equally lovely. In the new
world&mdash;at least in the northern regions&mdash;there
is a chill in the fall of the year.
The cold north-western winds, cradled
amidst palæocrystic ice, and blowing over
tundra and prairie, are untempered by
Gulf Stream or ocean. Untempered, too,
by cloud and moisture, they cut keen, and
reveal the leafless landscape in all its bareness.
And it may be that they bring with
them the thought that for many months
to come that landscape will be bare indeed&mdash;unless
covered with a shroud of snow.</p>

<p>Far different is autumn in England&mdash;I
<a class="pagenum" name="page_030" title="30"> </a>
write (this time) situate in the basin of
the Thames, and for many weeks I have
been watching summer slowly give up its
glowing glories in order that other glories,
not less wonderful in colour, may take their
place. For England is never colourless;
nay, in England, all through the year, the
colours are warm and sweet and comforting.
The very trunks and twigs of
the trees are warm with browns and greens
and purples, the result of the mosses and
lichens, minute epiphytic and parasitic
vegetation which the humid climate so
greatly fosters. Even brick walls, the
stepping-stones in brooks, wooden palings&mdash;everything
constructed by man, Nature
soon mellows with a gentle hand; so that,
in place of stark and staring edifices where
the bare boards or the dull paint form
blotches on the scene, you have everywhere
a great harmony of colour&mdash;violets
<a class="pagenum" name="page_031" title="31"> </a>
shading into green; greens gliding into
softest yellows; and these again deepening
into warm and beautiful orange and
gold and red.</p>

<p>A long, long tramp through beechy
Buckinghamshire one day revealed at
every step beauties that filled the eye&mdash;and
filled the heart. No pen could do
them justice; and, among painters, only
the brush of a Corot could attempt their
depicture without depriving them of their
exquisite, their almost evanescent, softness.
A great mist lay over the land; a
gentle, noiseless mist that hid from you
the horizon and the outer world; that
shut you in from the outer world; lured
you into that mood of quiet reverence
in the presence of quiet, wonder-working
Nature; and revealed to you ... I
cannot tell all that was revealed. I can
only point to this and that beautiful little
<a class="pagenum" name="page_032" title="32"> </a>
thing or vision, themselves but emblems
of a Beauty and a Mystery invisible.</p>

<p>Again I saw the little ivies in the ditches.
Again I saw unnumbered little leaves and
stalks and tendrils in the hedges; all, of
shape and texture and colour actually
and positively divine. The hedges, a
tangle of twigs thick with a hundred
growths, were mighty marvels that no
human clipping and pruning and trimming
could diminish. And at every few
paces rose out of these hedges, on either
hand, old majestic elms, great in girth,
tall of stature, interlacing their branches
high overhead and making for pygmy
me, who walked that winding lane, a
wondrous fane in which to worship.&mdash;It
was not exactly what one saw with one's
bodily eye that roused worship in that
fane. What was it?...</p>

<p>As morning grew towards noon, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_033" title="33"> </a>
the sun gained power, that gentle mist&mdash;so
noiseless, like an angel's hand laid
soothingly on me and on all that hemmed
me in&mdash;the mist mysteriously withdrew
itself. But only to show fresh loveliness.
On either hand were meadows, still lush
with grass; or brown and furrowed fields,
shot through with the myriad tips of growing
corn; and here and there in scattered
heaps lay the rich leaves of the oak and
the elm and the beech, brilliant in their
orange and russet, and here and there lit
up, like burnished gold, by glints of sunshine
from between the clouds.</p>

<p>For miles, quiet little scenes like this
filled the eye and the heart&mdash;entrancing,
exalting, humbling.</p>

<p>Wherein lay the secret of their appeal?
Why is it that field and hedgerow, winding
lane and interlacing boughs, strike upon
the emotions of man?</p>



<h2>
IX<a class="pagenum" name="page_034" title="34"> </a><br/>
<span class="smcaps">Spirituality of Nature</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 10</h3>

<p>One thing at least is certain. Of this
human race, of which each of us frail and
wailing mortals is a fragment, this kindly
or unkindly thing we call "external
Nature" is at once the mother, the cradle,
and the home: out of it we came; in it
we play; from it we delve our livelihood;
and&mdash;to it we go. For it is also our grave.
But, unlike the mournful mounds, so pitilessly
ranged in regular rows&mdash;as if, 'fore
God, to accentuate the fact that in Death
this impotent thing called sapient man
meets at last a uniforming and levelling
foe&mdash;unlike those mournful mounds we
<a class="pagenum" name="page_035" title="35"> </a>
see in cemeteries, external Nature is a
grave out of which there is a perpetual and
unceasing resurrection. Nature is at once
the tomb and the womb of life. What was
once soil and rain and sunshine becomes
grass&mdash;then hay&mdash;then beef or mutton
or milk&mdash;and, in time, the very bone and
muscle, the very laughter and tears of the
child that plays in those fields. And
when bone and muscle lay down that
subtle thing called Life, give up the spirit
and lie inert, they enter once again into
the tomb and womb of Nature, and the
mighty cycle begins afresh.</p>

<h3>
§ 11</h3>

<p>And this "spirit" is not a thing apart,
a thing outside Nature; breathed into
man at his birth, and wafted to some
mythical heaven&mdash;or hell&mdash;at his death.
Actually and actively in great Nature,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_036" title="36"> </a>
manifesting itself as soil and herb and
sunshine, is immanent that which, when
metamorphosed into so-called human Life,
manifests itself as feeling, imagination,
emotion, faith. There cannot be anything
<i>in esse</i> in Man that was not
aforetime <i>in posse</i> in Nature.</p>

<h3>
§ 12</h3>

<p>Never shall I forget the day upon which&mdash;and
the walk during which&mdash;there
flared upon me like a great and sudden
light the fact that the whole cosmos was
<i>alive</i>&mdash;was <span class="smcaps">Life</span>; that it was not composed
of two dissimilar things: (<i>a</i>) a gross
and ponderable "matter"; and (<i>b</i>) an
immaterial imponderable "mind." There
is no such dichotomy in Nature. All
is immaterial, spiritual, living. Every
particle in me is alive; but every particle
in me came from Nature; and, as I cannot
<a class="pagenum" name="page_037" title="37"> </a>
create life, life must have existed potentially
in those particles. My bodily
mechanism is merely a transmutation of
one form of life into another.</p>

<p>What we call "life" is a process; a
process kept agoing by (<i>a</i>) the ingestion
of surrounding material; and (<i>b</i>) the reproduction
of the individual which so
ingests.</p>

<p>Look at that field of oats growing there
to the right. You will admit, will you
not, that those little green blades just
springing from the soil are actually and
veritably the matter of the field in which
they grow? The silicon and phosphorus
and oxygen and nitrogen and carbon and
what-not, which were in the air or soil,
will by next July be gluten and protein.
If you and I should haggle over the origin
of the first oat-seed, at least if it did not
spring from this particular field, it had
<a class="pagenum" name="page_038" title="38"> </a>
not, I take it, any ultra-terrestrial origin.&mdash;Or
granted it had, as, I think, Arrhenius
argues, that origin was not extra-cosmic:
it came, certainly, from somewhere within
this our visible universe. Good! Let us
go back.&mdash;The oats then&mdash;that is, the
gluten and the protein&mdash;are but the
matter of soil and air and sunshine in
another form. So, then, is the porridge in
your plate. So, then, are <i>you</i>, surely. You
and I <i>are</i> this external Nature in another
shape; and if we had <i>n</i> senses and a
mind endowed with powers of discernment
and of comprehension <i>n</i>thly more
powerful than at present, we might be
able, not only to see the process of transformation
in its every stage, but&mdash;to
understand that matter is immaterial,
is spiritual (whatever that word may
connote); and that ourselves, the
porridge, the oats, the soil, the earth&mdash;the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_039" title="39"> </a>
Cosmos, are, is ... one and a
Mystery. In Nature, as in Man, resides
that Spirit of Eternal Things which we
call Life: a thing incomprehensible and
divine; transcending thought; one and
a unit; one with the thing that is, and
one with that which asks itself what it
is and whence it came; revealing itself
under the aspects of time and space, yet
unbounded by time or space; manifesting
itself under an infinitude of forms, yet
remaining one and the same; at once the
revealer and the revealed; the thing
thought of and the thing that thinks.</p>

<span class="smcaps">Practical Transcendentalism</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 13</h3>

<p>But of what avail are transcendental
themes like these for the conduct and
comfort of life? What light are they to
our path? To what goal do they point?</p>

<p>It is not a question that needs to be
asked. Were no investigation to be
undertaken, no theories formed, save for
some definite and preconceived purpose,
it may be that no new path would be
found, no more distant goal discerned.</p>

<p>And yet these meditations, such as
they were, crude in matter, inchoate in
form, mere adumbrations of a truth all
too dimly perceived, brought comfort.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_041" title="41"> </a>
Once more they took me away from the
trivial and the ephemeral. Above all,
they took me away from the geocentric.
So many creeds, so many religions, pin
me down to this little planet. How many
earths are there in the visible heavens?
Are there terrestrial sinners on each and
all? If so, for how many deaths did the
vicarious mercy of the Almighty call?
And even if we travel outside the realm
of Christendom, still we find our little
earth regarded as the centre of thought,
the only scene upon which the great drama
of Being is enacted: for so many philosophies
and religions accentuate the
isolated existence of individual human
beings, and limit their application to the
periphery of this speck in space.</p>

<p>I like the larger aspect. When we look
up to the stars and remember that they
are suns about which probably revolve
<a class="pagenum" name="page_042" title="42"> </a>
an infinitude of habitable earths&mdash;earths
of every conceivable and inconceivable
kind, and peopled probably with an
infinitude of beings&mdash;also of every conceivable
and inconceivable kind&mdash;some
perhaps as gross as we, others breathing
airs of heaven, requiring neither senses
nor anatomical organs, enjoying "the
communion of saints" by powers and
processes outside the ken of touch or
speech or vision ... we link ourselves
with the immensity of Being; we are not
separate little entities trudging a few miles
of earth, but particles of Omnipresent
Life, partakers in the history and destiny
of All that Is.</p>

§ 14</h3>

<p>There is a practical side, too, to these
transcendental themes. For what is Conscience,
that inward monitor which, whatever
<a class="pagenum" name="page_043" title="43"> </a>
your creed, bids you walk thus and
not otherwise, that applauds you when
you do right, and shames you when you
go wrong? From one point of view,
Conscience is the evolved consensus of
mankind, that inherited instinct which
declares that only such actions as subserve
the welfare of the race are right, and that
all others are wrong; and that distributes
its sanctions accordingly. From another,
and perhaps a rather fanciful, point of
view (and yet one that may appeal to
those who look forward to a life after
death and cling to a possibility of communication
between dead and living)&mdash;from
another point of view, Conscience
may be the inaudible voice of myriads of
fellow-creatures like unto ourselves, who,
having passed through the trials and
temptations of this life, and viewing this
life from the plane of a life supernal,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_044" title="44"> </a>
shout spiritually, warningly, in our psychic
ears when they see us doing the things that
brought them ill. But from another and
cosmic point of view, it is that absolute
and categorical imperative which dictates
that each attenuated portion of the All
shall act in Unison with the All, in the
history and destiny of which each attenuated
portion partakes.</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<span class="smcaps">Spring in Canada</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 15</h3>

<p>My next walks were in quite another hemisphere&mdash;to
wit, in the great and growing
colony of Canada.&mdash;From many points
of view Canada is one of the most interesting
of countries. From the rank of a
somewhat humble dependency, made up
of a heterogeneous collection of provinces,
she has sprung within the last few decades
into the rank of a proud and self-conscious
nation. The contrast is notable. Indeed
the country is one of contrasts. Her
climate, her scenery, her sentiments, her
people, her politics, all exhibit extremes
the most extraordinary. A winter of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_046" title="46"> </a>
Arctic severity is followed by a tropical
summer. Within sight of luxuriant pastures
glide stupendous glaciers. Flattest
prairies spread to the feet of mountain
ranges the rivals of the Alps; prim fields,
orchards, and vineyards encroach upon
primæval forests. Along with the hardy
apple and the far-famed No. 1 Manitoba
wheat, this land produces strawberries,
peaches, grapes, and melons. Constitutionally
content with British connexion,
her people are intimately influenced by
ideas and manners American. Indeed,
her people are as heterogeneous as herself.
The Maritime Provinces of the extreme
east hardly call themselves Canadian;
Quebec is French; Ontario is Canadian to
the core; so is Manitoba; in the North-West
Territories are settlers from almost
every nationality in Europe; British
Columbia, in the extreme west, again,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_047" title="47"> </a>
fights shy of the cognomen Canadian.
Newfoundland holds aloof altogether. A
rude and toilsome social life goes hand
in hand with patches of refinement and
culture unmistakable. Canadian cheese
took the prize at Chicago; Canadian
poetry has been crowned by the Academy.
Lauding democratic institutions to the
skies, Radical to the last degree, Canada
nevertheless contains within herself castes
and cliques in their horror of such principles
almost rabid. With a political
system the counterpart of the British,
her politics are rife with personalities,
election protests, corruption trials.</p>

<p>However, I am not here concerned
with political or social tendencies or
delinquencies.</p>

<h3>
§ 16</h3>

<p>Soon after I arrived I betook me, one
spring, in my canoe, down the banks of the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_048" title="48"> </a>
River Otonabee. Pitching a tent, I made
this a focus from which I radiated in any
direction I chose&mdash;dawdling and sauntering
and lounging and seeing what there
was to be seen.</p>

<p>And what is there to be seen? Well,
let me give you here another little
photograph.</p>

<p>I write, sitting ensconced, sheltered
from sun and wind, between two huge
roots of the stump of a burned pine on a
bare hill overlooking the river. Not a
place in which to see much, you would say.
Pardon me, you are wrong. You, shut
in between four superficies of wall-paper,
a whitewashed ceiling, and a carpet,
know absolutely nothing of the clouded
sky as I know it, gazing at it unconfined
from horizon to zenith. Far overhead,
the delicatest vapoury cirri fleck the purest
blue; in the distance, bold, rounded,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_049" title="49"> </a>
white cumuli rise above a misty haze of
grey, against which as a background rise
in points and curves and lines dark green
firs and round-topped birches and emerald
hill-sides; and below these, and nearer,
comes the water&mdash;in no two spots the
same&mdash;ruffled and unruffled, wavy and
still, dark blue and lead-grey, in eddies
and in currents; here dimpled, there
like a mirror; now dazzling you with a
thousand flashing, floating stars; there
sullenly bearing up the reflections and
shadows of the great, dark trees above
it&mdash;at one moment thus, and while
you say it, otherwise.&mdash;For a symbol of
God&mdash;serene, shapeless, profound, in
eternal repose, unchanging, all-embracing,
majestic&mdash;give me the blue sky; for a
symbol of Man&mdash;tossed, shapen, ever
at strife, changeful, unresting, evanescent,
with dark depths and foul weeds, sombre
<a class="pagenum" name="page_050" title="50"> </a>
and woeful when deprived of the light of
heaven, and beautiful only when beautified
by skyey tints&mdash;give me the water.
And after the water, and closer, comes
my foreground&mdash;tufted grass and brown
soil, with dandelions and clover and
mullein, and here and there a piece of
glistering granite or a quaint-shaped,
rotting tree trunk. Amongst these hops
fearless, while I sit still and silent with
half-closed eyes, the thrush or the grey-bird,
chasing insects a few feet from my
foot; while above me, on the very stump
against which I lean, perches the various-coloured
high-holder.&mdash;Truly, it seems as
if Nature had taken me to be one with her,
recognised me as part of her manifold
immensity, looked upon me as a consort,
a co-mate.</p>

<p>And am I not a part of her? It needs
not to comprehend the harmonious workings
<a class="pagenum" name="page_051" title="51"> </a>
of mighty natural laws to perceive the
unity of all things. Each minutest spot
on this earth verifies the truth. I need
not move a step to find evidences of it.
I look at my blackened stump, and not one
square inch can I find which is not instinct
with evidences of life within life; life
interfused with, dependent on, correlated
with other life, with signs of the ceaseless
being born, growing, dying&mdash;with processes
interlinked with processes. It is a
universe of processes, this in which we
live; not a universe <i>in which</i> this, that,
and the other separate thing exists for a
time, but a universe <i>of</i> subsistences, made
up wholly of interdependent existences.
Wherever I look on my trunk I see mosses
and lichens and creeping ants and beetles,
and the holes of boring worms, and the
marks of woodpeckers' beaks, chrysalises,
seeds, twigs. To each of these the stump
<a class="pagenum" name="page_052" title="52"> </a>
is its universe: they regard it as we do
the solar system, as a place, a locality,
made for them to inhabit. They do not
understand that the tree is itself but part
of a greater whole of life, of thought;
a link in an endless chain of existence.
And so we often forget that this infinitely
various and changing universe which we
call ours, which we look upon as our habitation,
our dwelling-house, in which we
move about as lords and masters, is after
all but an infinitesimal fragment of the
real demesne of the true Lord of the
Manor. And what if after all we were not
even bailiffs of this manor? What if
we were but the furniture in some small
attic&mdash;mirrors, it may be&mdash;and that what
we call our universe prove to be nothing
more than the small part of this attic
which is reflected in us!</p>

<span class="smcaps">Autumn in Canada</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 17</h3>

<p>This was in the spring. But I remember
an autumn walk in Canada that was very
different from this, both in the locality
chosen and in the scenes viewed.</p>

<p>Late in October once, a friend and
myself had three whole days' holiday!&mdash;rare
and joyous boon! We took a train
to the little Ontarian town of Stayner.
From Stayner to the shores of the
Georgian Bay was a little trudge of about
three miles. But a trudge it was; for
the train had been late; our knapsacks
were heavy; the sun had set; and both
darkness and hunger came on apace.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_054" title="54"> </a>
But at last the shore was reached. And
what a shore it was! For, beating on it
from far away to the north was a wealth
of waters&mdash;oceanic in magnitude, sombre
as the sea and, as the sea, mysterious.</p>

<p>As we walked, the night closed in, the
northern night, so beautiful, so clear, so
immense. But it was chill and dark, and
either we must advance, or we must seek
shelter where we were. Shall it be a
leafy "lean-to" under a pine, constructed
of heaped-up boughs, or shall it be a
trudge to a civilised hostelry? Such
were the problems discussed over sandwiches
and hard-boiled eggs (washed
down with sandy water from the bay), as
we sat on a wave-washed log, the wind
blowing strong in our faces. The ground
was damp as damp; the pines seemed
lugubriously incompetent to shelter from
the growing gale. Blankets we had none;
<a class="pagenum" name="page_055" title="55"> </a>
night was upon us.&mdash;We decided to
walk.</p>

<p>On the left was this rolling Georgian
ocean, seemingly illimitable. In its
northern stretches it reached up to
Hudson's Bay, to the Arctic; and by its
southern streams it drave down to Lake
Ontario, to the St Lawrence, to the
Atlantic. It was one with this Atlantic;
it was one with the Pacific; it was first
cousin to the Indian Ocean, and but once
or twice removed from all the waters of
the world, since they and it had a common
origin.</p>

<p>The walking was superb. The sand
was firm as asphalt: on the right was
dimly visible a friendly fringe of trees&mdash;pine
and scrub and brushwood; on the
left there was ever that never-ceasing roll
of waves&mdash;waves once more linking me
with Ostend and Hove, Rotterdam and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_056" title="56"> </a>
Rangoon, St John in New Brunswick,
Ascension Isle, the Cape of Good Hope,
and the palm-fringed coast of Malabar.</p>

<p>We walked. And we walked fast.
But not too fast to notice. There was no
moon. The stars came out, and in that
pellucid northern air, where was no dust
of road nor smoke of chimney, those stars
shone as assuredly never can they shine
elsewhere. It is a literal fact that, in
order to determine whether or not the
great luminous patches which I gazed at
overhead were the veritable Milky Way
or only drifting clouds lit up by starlight,
I had to look again and again, and
to take note as to whether there was
perceptible any change of shape. There
was not. It was the Galaxy itself; but
so revealed, so clearly seen, so unremote,
as it were, that once again the great
portals of the Infinite seemed to open,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_057" title="57"> </a>
and to permit a glimpse into the mysterious
abode of Being&mdash;inadequate term by
which we feebly connote the supreme
unity of all that is. To permit a glimpse,
too, into that puzzle of puzzles, the not
impossible identification or unification or
intussusception of that All with the
smallest of its integral contents. For was
not that assemblage of suns&mdash;those masses
of solar systems, so numerous as to seem
but a mist&mdash;was it not actually depicted
on the tiny retina of the eye? It was;
and, through this depicture, it was, as
it were, intellectually embraced in the
thinking mind behind; a fact symbolical
of the truth, as yet but dimly comprehended,
that in very deed the
infinitesimal unit and the mighty All
are one and identical.</p>

<p>However, ontological speculations
under an autumnal sky have their limit;
<a class="pagenum" name="page_058" title="58"> </a>
and glad indeed were we, after long search
among the pines and the hemlocks, to
find, albeit it was late, a hostel in
which were warmth and shelter for the
night.</p>




<h2>
XIII<a class="pagenum" name="page_059" title="59"> </a><br/>
<span class="smcaps">Winter in Canada</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 18</h3>

<p>I remember me, too, of a notable
winter's walk in Canada.</p>

<p>For some reason, one night in mid-January,
Sleep forsook me. After wooing
her in vain, I rose at three and lighted an
ungainly but highly satisfactory stove.
It had a draught like a Bessemer furnace,
drawing through an ugly stove-pipe which
ran bolt upright, turned sharp before it
reached the ceiling, and disappeared in a
hole in the wall&mdash;an apparatus quite the
most conspicuous article of furniture in
the room (it was in a hotel). On this I
warmed a cup of tea, then donned all the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_060" title="60"> </a>
warm clothing I could find; and in some
forty minutes was afoot.</p>

<p>My point of departure was a little
Ontarian country town of some ten
thousand inhabitants&mdash;we will call it
Dummer. Dummer stood in a slightly
higher latitude than the parallels which
run through the belt of country skirting
the northern shore of the Great Lakes,
along which are dotted most of the centres
of population; and accordingly it was exposed
to a slightly severer wintry climate.
At the time of my visit it was enveloped
in snow. Snow lay deep over the whole
land, thick on every roof, over the edges
of which it protruded itself in irregular
curves&mdash;solid cataracts suspended in air,
and vainly endeavouring to complete their
descent by long six-foot icicles. Snow-white
was every road, save for the two
dirty grooves beaten down by the hoofs
<a class="pagenum" name="page_061" title="61"> </a>
of horses. Snow covered the country, far
as the eye could reach; glistening like
glaciers on the hill-sides, deep purple and
blue in the patches shaded by the pines;
only the woods showing black against the
dazzling white, the perpendicular walls of
the wooden farm buildings, the solitary
trees and shrubs, and the straggling snake-fences&mdash;long,
unshaped logs of split
timber, their ends placed zigzag the one
over the other, to keep the structure erect&mdash;relieved
the white monotony. And yet
this belt of country is almost in the same
latitude with the south of France, with
the Riviera, whence but a few days before
I had received in a letter a violet!</p>

<p>When I started, there was no moon,
there were no stars; my sole light was
the skyey reflection of the electric lamps
of the city; and only this for many miles
enabled me to distinguish the grooves in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_062" title="62"> </a>
which I had to walk from the high ridge
of snow between them which I had to
avoid. When I skirted the lee side of a
high hill, or passed the distal edge of a
thick wood, I floundered from one to other
in the dark. The landscape, such of it
as could be seen under a leaden-grey sky,
was a vast monochrome, an expanse of
dull white picked out with blotches and
points and lines of black. Not a living
thing was to be seen. Not a sound was
to be heard. And, what particularly
struck a lover of country walks, not the
faintest suspicion of any kind of a scent
was to be detected. Everything seemed
to be dumb and dead; and the tiny
flakes which fell in myriads, fell so silently,
so pitilessly, had seemingly for their object
the making of all things, if possible, still
more dumb and dead.&mdash;There is always
something poetic about snow in England.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_063" title="63"> </a>
There is something playful and jocular
in the way in which lusty standard rose-trees,
stout shrubs, and sturdy hedges don
aged Winter's garb, as a laughing maid
will half demurely wear her grand-dam's
cap. In the Western Hemisphere, away
from the genial influences of the Gulf
Stream, even in the same latitudes, winter
is a more serious matter. The snow
comes "to stay." There is little jocosity
about it. It lies several feet thick. If
it disappears during a temporary thaw, it
comes again very soon. Here the trees
do not sport with it. They put up with
it. They stand knee-deep in it, leafless,
motionless, scentless, soundless. If there
is a wind, it sweeps through them with a
long thin swish, like the wail of a host of
lost spirits seeking shelter. Not a branch
falls&mdash;the autumn blasts brought down all
that was frangible. Only frozen tears
<a class="pagenum" name="page_064" title="64"> </a>
fall, fall from the ice-encrusted twigs.
For miles on either side of me stood these
patient trees; thick, black, heavy-boughed
cedars, their stout trunks buried in snow,
squatting, like Mr Kipling's Djinn of All
Deserts, on their haunches and vainly
"thinking a Magic" to make idling Winter
"hump himself"; beech-trees, naked
but for a few scattered sere and yellow
leaves fluttering about their waists; the
drooping-branched elm, not half so graceful
as when full-leafed; elegant maples
with a tracery of twigs far too fine to be
compared to lace. These trees formed
often the outermost fringe of thick woods.
Into these I penetrated. A profound
silence pervaded them, a silence so intense,
so all-embracing, it seemed to overflow
the forest, to go out into space, to enwrap
the world in its grasp. Not a thing stirs.
To be alive in that shrine of death-like
<a class="pagenum" name="page_065" title="65"> </a>
soundlessness seems desecration. It is
supreme, infinite, absolute; you, the
living, moving onlooker, are finite and
relative, a thing of time and space. To
think is to disturb the serenity of its
repose, for to think is to attempt to limit
it, to reduce it to the level of yourself, and
no thought is large enough to compass it.
Only some shaggy elk, hoofed and horned,
diabolically crashing through crust upon
crust of superimposed layers of frozen
snow; and only demoniacal little troops
of wolves, pattering fiendishly, are fit to
defy or to disturb this deity of Quiet.
It is large, expansive, in its influence.
Summer sights and sounds bind you to a
spot, limit your attention to a locality,
accentuate the petty, the individual, the
trivial. The wintry woods, the white
unfurrowed fields, stimulate no sense.
The soul of man seems bared to the soul
<a class="pagenum" name="page_066" title="66"> </a>
of Nature, and human thought and the
universal mind seem contiguous and
conterminous.&mdash;Silence affects the mind
as darkness affects the senses: both in
their impressiveness quicken the faculties
to the utmost; and yet, as no sense can
perceive the impalpability of darkness, so
no thought can pierce the impenetrability
of silence.&mdash;One must visit a wintry clime
to experience emotions such as these.</p>

<p>As I walked, the wind rose, and its noise
in the convolutions of the ear, so still
was everything else, became almost
annoying in its resounding roar. I had
followed devious and untravelled ways in
the semi-darkness, and this wind it was
that told me when again I reached a high-road&mdash;namely,
by the whistling of the
telegraph wires. I never heard such
obstreperous wires. They made an
Æolian harp truly hyperborean in timbre
<a class="pagenum" name="page_067" title="67"> </a>
and volume. Every note in the scale of
audible human sound seemed struck; and
were there such a thing as an acoustical
spectroscope, it would have shown, not
only every tone and semitone in the
gamut, but ultra-treble and infra-bass
notes also. And it was played <i>fortissimo</i>.
Those wires shrieked, bellowed. Whether
at that early hour they were carrying
messages, I do not know; but all the
intensity of human anguish, human
happiness, and human woe seemed to be
flowing through their scrannel lengths;
and the thin hapless things plained of
their freight to the unheeding winds.
It was a weird sound far out there in the
desolate wild, with not a soul to hear or
sympathise&mdash;for I, what was I in all that
huge expanse? They wotted not of me.</p>

<p>Then the great sky by degrees broke up
into masses of cloud, and here and there
<a class="pagenum" name="page_068" title="68"> </a>
between them shone out the steady stars&mdash;imperturbable,
piercing, shaken not
by the slightest twinkle. One rich and
brilliant planet in the west glowed argent
in the blue&mdash;a blue into which the eye
penetrated far, far into infinity. The
Canadian sky is ever lofty, pellucid, profound;
very different from the close
canopy so common in cloudy England.</p>

<p>But it was high time to turn homewards.
A faint light overspread the
east; things began to take shape;
houses, instead of appearing as dark
blotches against the white, now looked
like habitable dwellings; the separate
boughs were distinguishable on the trees.
As one neared the town signs of life were
seen&mdash;and smelled; the pungent odour of
the "coal-oil" with which the impatient
and unthrifty housewife coaxed her wood
fire more rapidly to catch, smote almost
<a class="pagenum" name="page_069" title="69"> </a>
smartingly upon the nostril. Sleepy-eyed
mechanics, buttoned to the throat, heavily
"overshoed," and with hands bepocketed,
strode sullenly workwards.
Later on "cutters"&mdash;so are called the
comfortable little one-horsed sleighs just
seating a couple&mdash;sped hither and thither.
Then a milk-cart or two glided past, the
cans wrapped in furs, the hairs on the
horses' muzzles showing white with
cleaving ice. Later still, and when within
the precincts of the town proper, children
were met espying sleighs on which to get
"rides" to school. It was a different
world now. A dazzling sun transformed
the dull dead landscape of the night into
a blinding spangled sheet of purest white.
Involuntarily the eyes half closed against
that glare. No wonder the sub-Arctic
eye lacks the large frank openness of those
of softer realms; against even the summer
<a class="pagenum" name="page_070" title="70"> </a>
sunshine the protection of approximated
eyelids is needed, as the crow's-feet of the
farmers' features prove. If Canada has
earned the title of Our Lady of the Snows,
she certainly equally deserves the title
of Our Lady of the Sunshine; nowhere
is sunshine so bright or so abundant; so
bright and abundant that it is not unreasonable
to suppose that it has not a
little to do with the elimination of that
"phlegm" from the descendants of the
immigrant of that land to the folk of which
the French attribute that characteristic.
"There are few, if any, places in England,"
says the Director of the Meteorological
Service of Canada, "that have a larger
normal annual percentage [of bright sunshine]
than thirty-six, and there are
many as low as twenty-five; whereas in
Canada most stations exceed forty, and
some few have as high a percentage as
<a class="pagenum" name="page_071" title="71"> </a>
forty-six."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"
href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> "Weather permitting" is
a phrase but rarely heard in Canada.</p>

<p>But my early morning walk was over.
It was one I would not have exchanged
for many another taken under more
genial skies.</p>

<span class="smcaps">The Mood for Walking</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 19</h3>

<p>A morning walk is worth the effort of
getting up. Much would I give to have
been of that party which, in sixteen
hundred and something, "stretched their
legs up Tottenham Hill towards the
Thatched House in Hoddesdon on that
fine fresh May morning"&mdash;I mean Messrs
<i>Piscator</i>, <i>Venator</i>, and <i>Auceps</i>. I should
have been <i>Peregrinator</i>; and whereas
<i>Piscator</i> praised the water, and <i>Venator</i>
the land, and <i>Auceps</i> the air, as the
element in which each respectively
traded, I should have praised all three,
for the pedestrian's pleasures derive from
<a class="pagenum" name="page_073" title="73"> </a>
no single one. And to walking I should
have applied dear old Izaak Walton's
own phrase, that it, like angling, was
"most honest, ingenious, quiet, and
harmless."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"
href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Upon quiet, Walton sets
extraordinary stress. Quoting with
approbation the learned Peter du Moulin,
he tells us that "when God intended to
reveal any future events or high notions
to his prophets, he then carried them
either to the deserts or the sea-shore, that
having so separated them from amidst
the press of people and business, and the
cares of the world, he might settle their
mind in a quiet repose, and there make
them fit for revelation."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"
href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It is strange that Izaak Walton, himself
apparently a most quiet and contented
old man (he lived to be ninety-one),
<a class="pagenum" name="page_074" title="74"> </a>
should, writing at sixty years of age, and
two hundred and fifty years ago&mdash;when
I suppose there was no faster or noisier
thing than a galloping horse&mdash;should so
insistently preach and teach quiet. Yet,
perhaps we must remember that he lived
through the Great Rebellion. The last
words of his book&mdash;and he puts them into
his own, <i>Piscator's</i>, mouth&mdash;are:</p>

<p>"And [let the blessing of St Peter's
Master be] upon all that are lovers of

<p>Why, I do not exactly know, but there
is to me something straightforward,
honest, and simple-minded in the idea of
ending a book with the words "and go
a-angling." This and the quotation
<a class="pagenum" name="page_075" title="75"> </a>
from 1 Thess. iv. 11 sum up for me the
character of the man and the book.</p>

<h3>
§ 20</h3>

<p>Walking rivals angling in demanding
and engendering quiet. "To make a
walk successful," says another dear old
gentleman, writing at the same time of
life but in modern times, "mind and
body should be free of burthen."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
true and abiding joy of walking is in calm.
"The mood," says John Burroughs, "in
which you set out on a spring or autumn
<a class="pagenum" name="page_076" title="76"> </a>
ramble or a sturdy winter walk ... is
the mood in which your best thoughts and
impulses come to you.... Life is sweet
in such moods, the Universe is complete,
and there is no failure or imperfection
anywhere."<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"
href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Only Nature can induce
such moods&mdash;</p>

<p class="poemcenter">
"Dear Nature is the kindest mother still,"</p>

<p class="indent0">says the soul-tossed, self-torturing Byron.
Books, music, art, the drama, philosophy,
science&mdash;at bottom there seems to be
something disquieting in these. They
come in such questionable shape. They
are the works of man; and we never
altogether trust the works of man. We
never feel, even with the first of those who
know, that our fellow-man, who is, after
all, like unto ourselves, has answered
every question, allayed every doubt,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_077" title="77"> </a>
stilled every fear. Was something of
this in Matthew Arnold's mind when
he cried:</p>

<p class="poemcenter">
"One lesson, <i>Nature</i>, let me learn of thee,"</p>

<p class="indent0">and prayed her to calm, to compose
him to the end?&mdash;But enough in praise
of calm. Calm is compatible with the
highest and most exuberant spirits. Indeed,
high and exuberant spirits are the
first and natural outcome of a mind at
peace with itself. Good old Walton is
continually breaking out into pious or
pastoral song&mdash;and making milkmaids
and milkmaids' mothers break out into
song, too.</p>

<span class="smcaps">Evening Meditations</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 21</h3>

<p>If, as Messieurs <i>Piscator</i>, <i>Venator</i>, and
<i>Auceps</i>, and their tuneful milkmaids, show,
early morning walks tend to blithesomeness
of heart, evening walks tend perhaps
to meditation of mind. As day wears on&mdash;I
do not know, I may be wrong, but to
me it seems that as day wears on it takes
a more sombre aspect. It was at dusk
that Gray's Elegy was written. In the
very sound of Milton's simple words,</p>

<p class="poemcenter">
"Then came still evening on,"</p>

<p class="indent0">there is to me an echo of quietness,
perhaps of melancholy.&mdash;Many a lesson
I have learned by quiet meditation in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_079" title="79"> </a>
quiet scenes, prolonged far into the night.&mdash;Indeed,
he is a wise walker who chooses
for himself one or more secluded spots,
sequestered deep, whither he may go,
there to commune with himself; or to
hold high converse with the mighty dead;
or to lend an expectant ear for the dryads
of the woods; or, if nothing more, to rid
him of the petty perturbations incident
to a life lived between four walls, a floor,
and a ceiling, and broken into fragments
by clocks which strike the hours and
watches which point to the minute.</p>

<h3>
§ 22</h3>

<p>One such spot I have, and from it many
a lesson I have learned.&mdash;It is a great
amphitheatre, Nature-made, vast and
open. It slopes to the north and west,
and all about it and about are green trees&mdash;green
trees and shrubs and lowly plants.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_080" title="80"> </a>
In the whole space I am the one spectator&mdash;save
for little grasses that stand on
tiptoe to look and listen; save for little
weeds that nod their heads; and a beetle
crawling heedless over dry and shining
grains of sand. In the orchestral centre,
where, in ancient Greece, should stand the
lighted altar, there chances to be a little
crimson maple; and behind and beyond
rise verdant hills. Before me, as where
should be the stage, stand, in green habiliments,
beech and elm and fir; oak and
cedar; lithe and virginal saplings; broad-shouldered
pines, staid and stalwart&mdash;a
goodly company, goodly and green,
wondrous green; and for me they act and
pose and sing.... The drama opens.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is no fanfaronade. On the left,
against a dove-grey cloud, the topmost
twigs of a silver poplar rustle, the signal
<a class="pagenum" name="page_081" title="81"> </a>
to commence. Gently, and with grace
supreme, the boughs begin a cosmic song,
and sway the while they chant. They
dip and fall, and lightly rise; take hands
and touch, and smile, and sing again.
Troop after troop takes up the measure
as the wind sweeps through the trees, and
there is revealed to the eye and to the ear
sound and motion obedient to an unseen
power.... The movement deepens.
Great masses join the dance, swell the
vespertinal hymn. Huge and cumbrous
boughs sweep back and forth, melodious,
eloquent; and from tremulous leaf to
swaying limb rises a choric song, beautiful,
wonderful.... Of what is it that they
speak?</p>

<hr />

<p>Presently, beneath the dove-grey cloud,
the red sun momentarily shows. Gleams
strike the amphitheatre, the stage. My
<a class="pagenum" name="page_082" title="82"> </a>
neighbour grasses glint in the sheen, the
beetle's wing-sheaths glow; the sand
grains glisten, and, overhead, the veined
leaves of the larch, which before were
black against the sky, become translucent
to the light. The massed greens
grow radiant; solitary boughs shake
sunshine from their locks; the shrubs
stand out overt; a divine gleesomeness
fills all the wood.... Whence comes the
mystic impulse?</p>

<hr />

<p>Then slowly evening falls. The wind
dies down. A fitful breeze, now warm
with Summer's breath, now chill, strays
aimless; and the major song sinks to a
key in flats.&mdash;The sun sinks. The green
shadows grow black; and where before
was great leafage, is now a great gloom,
in which even the white-stemmed birches
lose their tapering limbs. Gone are the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_083" title="83"> </a>
leaves of the larch; the shrubs hide;
the beetle creeps out of sight. A far-off
rill mingles a bass <i>maestoso</i> sob with its
treble trill; and slowly, very slowly, a
thin thin mist creates itself in every
cranny of the dell. Only I am left, dull
of hearing, miscomprehending, obtuse.</p>

<p>Only a little scene in an unending play;
for all through the night, and for endless
days and nights, before man was, and
long after man will be, these leafy persons
uplift that solemn chant, enact that
choric dance: now frolicsome and free;
now plaintive: now expectant, patient,
still.... What is it that they hymn?</p>

<h3>
§ 23</h3>

<p>It is but little that I, I and the heedless
beetle, comprehend of this mighty but
mystical drama. Some supernal power
impels them, so it seems, and they hymn
<a class="pagenum" name="page_084" title="84"> </a>
and praise this power; some hidden force,
emanating in regions far beyond the sun,
yet immanent in the grass blade, in the
leaflet, in the sand grains at my feet.
Often a darksome power, ruthless, blind;
slaying horde on horde; spilling blood
like water; scattering real pain and
poignant agony like hail; yet often thrilling,
joyous, tremulous with bliss&mdash;inscrutable,
recondite, dark. It is formed
and transformed into myriad shapes, out-running
time, out-living life; muted and
re-muted, here into gross and ponderable
matter, there into filmiest air; anon
revealing itself as exuberant life; again
vanishing in so-called death; a breath;
a spirit; the soul of eternal things....
Some hidden power they hymn.</p>

<hr />

<p>The darkness deepens. The mist
grows thick apace, heavy and sombre.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_085" title="85"> </a>
The keen jagged edge that cut the
horizon is blunted. The mystic play is
withdrawn; the persons of the drama
vanish; and spectators and stage, proscenium
and scene, the ampitheatre, the
open earth, and the illimitable sky, are
blent into one dark and invisible whole.</p>

<hr />

<p>Then in the silence of night I heard the
soundless voice of that Spirit of Eternal
Things: that Mystery, impenetrable as
the dark, impalpable: revealing itself as
one with the shapes it took and one with
the impulse they obeyed; in the grass
blade and the leaf, and in the wind to
which they swayed; in the ponderous
earth that, darkling, rolls through space,
and in the subtle mind that holds this
earth in fee. The vast and the far-off
were embraced in the vision, for from the
remotest star came rays that united me
<a class="pagenum" name="page_086" title="86"> </a>
with it. The minute and the trivial
were summoned from their hiding to
prove themselves near and akin. Magnitude
and proportion were swallowed up
in unity; number and computation disappeared
in a stupendous integer. Not
a leaf shook, not a bud burst, but was
moved to motion and to life by forces
infinite and remote, ante-dating sun or
star, one with sun and star, older than the
Milky Way, vaster than the limits of vision.
For in each leaflet of the boscage ran a
sap ancient as ocean; and but yesterday,
in the history of Time, that whole assemblage
was something far other than it is.
Bud and leaf were but manifestations of
a something supreme&mdash;a Force, a Spirit,
a God; a mysterious Thing that took hold
of dew and sunshine and soil and transformed
them into shape and perfume.
And sunshine and dew and soil were in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_087" title="87"> </a>
turn themselves but mutations of things,
chemical elements or movements of molecules;
and these again but mutations
of things more subtle still&mdash;atoms or
electrons, infinitesimal and innominate
particles; till ultimately, surely, we
arrive at something immense, immutable.&mdash;Something
there must be behind all
change; behind all appearances Something
that Appears. And the last appearance,
and the sum-total of appearances,
must be potential in the first, as in the
acorn is contained a potential forest.
Given one acorn, and enough of space and
time, and there is actually possible a
cosmos of oaks; and every oak different,
and no two twigs alike. So, could we
explain the electron, we should comprehend
the inane; in the moment lies
concealed the æon. Indeed, it is only to
time-fettered space-bound man that these
<a class="pagenum" name="page_088" title="88"> </a>
are not one and identical. And, if in leaf
and bud, then in perceiving mind. For
somehow mind, this wondering mind of
man, arose upon this planet; uprose,
appeared, became. No trailing comet,
surely, in wanton sport, showered mind
upon this world. Whencesoever it arose,
being here, and fed and nurtured by all
things here, emergent from matter, a
fragment of earth and sea and sky, surely
in this mind of man must also be that
self-same hidden power....</p>

<hr />

<p>I, too, then, was one of a mystic band,
was in the hands of the self-same power,
was indeed but a mutation amid its
mutations, and had a part to play on my
little stage, a part without which the
mighty drama would be incomplete, however
lowly it were. For, as by inexorable
law the youngest leaflet in that dell was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_089" title="89"> </a>
potentially existent from before all time,
could not help but be and sway and flutter
in the breeze, so I in my little world.
But what the mighty drama portended or
portrayed I knew as little as did the heedless
beetle that had crept out of sight;
and surely, he, poor little soul, had as
much right to know as I&mdash;not many
mutations, on this paltry planet, separated
me from him. Only I saw, behind all,
some ineffable power enacting an ineffable
drama: playwright and protagonist in
one; conceiving and enacting an endless
plot; manifesting itself to itself, yet ever
remaining the thing unmanifest; sundering
itself into innumerable myriads, yet
remaining one and a whole&mdash;incomprehensible&mdash;divine.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"
href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_090" title="90"> </a>
By degrees the great sky broke up into
clouds. A half moon, cut into fantastic
shapes by the twigs, peered through the
trees; and as I thridded the boles&mdash;I
miscomprehending, obtuse, merely a
larger atom in a small inane, finding my
devious way by a doubly reflected light&mdash;the
scene was shifted, fresh actors
called, and the great drama went on,
unfolding for ever a tale without end.</p>




<h2>
XVI<a class="pagenum" name="page_091" title="91"> </a><br/>
<span class="smcaps">The Unity of Nature</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 24</h3>

<p>The lesson I learned was this: Nature
is vast. Nature knows nothing of Time.
Nor does Nature know anything of Space.
It is we who import spatial and temporal
limitations into Nature. Because we
look up with two eyes, and feel forth with
two arms, and walk about with two legs,
we think, not only that <i>our</i>, but that
<i>the</i>, universe is an infinite sphere!&mdash;an
actual objective sphere of which each
stupidly assumes that <i>he</i> is the centre!
Which means that there are, supposedly,
millions of centres, and each centre changing
its place by millions of miles a day!&mdash;positive
<a class="pagenum" name="page_092" title="92"> </a>
proof of the preposterousness
of the assumption.&mdash;To an animalcule
born and bred inside an old garden hose,
the universe, I suppose, is an endless
tunnel. To a baby cockroach hatched
between floor and carpet, the universe is
a limitless plane. Well, we are animalcules
on a little rolling clod; and this
clod may bear the same relation to some
supernal, <i>n</i>-dimensional mansion and
garden&mdash;and gardeners and Owner, as
does my supposititious caoutchouc hose
or patterned carpet to some terrestrial
demesne.</p>

<hr />

<p>And so with Time. Time is a matter
of individual memory, of remembering
past events and of anticipating (which is
memory reversed, as it were; memory
projected) events to come. And memory,
as we know it, is purely a matter of this
<a class="pagenum" name="page_093" title="93"> </a>
or that sort of nerve-substance in the
brain. Had we no memory, we should
know nothing whatsoever of time; an
event would be a point, and no past
point could be recalled, nor any future
one conjectured. So, could an infinite
number of memories coalesce, there would
be no time either, for in that case all
events would occur here and now.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nature&mdash;the Cosmos&mdash;the All&mdash;the
Deity ... <i>He</i> is not limited by cubical
contents nor by clocks striking the hours.</p>

<h3>
§ 25</h3>

<p>How convey a notion of this mysterious
Unity? Shall we essay a gross and
inadequate analogy?</p>

<p>There are in the blood of man little
things called white corpuscles. They are
<a class="pagenum" name="page_094" title="94"> </a>
alive; they are, in fact, little living personages.
Indeed, it would be hard to
deny that they possess a certain sort of
"intelligence"; for, according to the
phagocytic theory, they attack their foes
and help their friends. Now, if
these white corpuscles ever reason about
the world which they inhabit, they must
think that it consists of an immense red
ocean in a perpetual flux, limitless and
restless, and peopled with myriads of
beings like unto themselves. Yet they
are an integral part of the human frame;
indeed without them the human frame
could not be what it is. Well, man's
place in <i>his</i> universe may be very similar
to that of the white corpuscle in its; and
the intelligence and nature of the Being
of which man forms an integral part
may be as inconceivable to man&mdash;to bewildered
man, buried 'neath an ocean of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_095" title="95"> </a>
air, and blown about space without even
a "by your leave"&mdash;as are man's to the
leucocytes of the blood.</p>

<p>If there is no such thing as Space
objectively existing outside our groping
human selves; and if there is no such
thing as Time, also objectively existing independent
of our remembering and anticipating
human selves; if also Death is
but Life undergoing Change (for Life is
not a thing extraneous to the cosmos,
and there is nothing in the cosmos that
can ever go out of it); if even Change
itself is but a process so named because
of the necessities of our temporal and
spatial conditions; and what we call
"multiplicity" or "manifoldness" merely
a word coined by our incompetence
to perceive the interdependence of all
that is ... why, then, surely, one with
and interpenetrating our own little space-bound,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_096" title="96"> </a>
time-fettered lives, there must be
an Absolute Life, indiscerptible because
coherent; immutable, because unspatial;
inexorable, because timeless; not to be
gainsaid, because all-embracing; whose
behests the human spirit, because identical
with and contained in it, must and
cannot but obey.</p>

<h3>
§ 26</h3>

<p>However, that there is a flaw in my
Philosophy and a flaw in my Creed, I do
not conceal from myself.&mdash;If, underlying
and upholding all phenomenal multiplicity,
there is a noumenal unity, how
it comes about that there is evil and
suffering and injustice and pain I do
not know. Nor do I know how, if that
Unity (including man) is governed by
infrangible law, it comes about that we
obtain notions of Responsibility and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_097" title="97"> </a>
Will; how we feel that we ought to act
thus and not otherwise, and have the
power to choose the good from the evil.</p>

<p>Yet I comfort myself thus:&mdash;Human
reason, after all, is inadequate for the explanation
of anything superhuman. But
there may be in man a faculty of imagination
or feeling or emotion or faith&mdash;call it
what you like&mdash;that <i>insists</i> upon our
trying to act thus and not otherwise;
upon our helping on the good and
eradicating the bad; and that leaves the
problem of the Origin of Evil and the
problem of the Freedom of the Will to
another sphere and another stage in the
upward emergence of mind.</p>

<h3>
§ 27</h3>

<p>Of the Origin of Evil I have no solution
whatsoever. Why it is that not a single
human being can go through his short
<a class="pagenum" name="page_098" title="98"> </a>
threescore years and ten without pain,
anguish, disappointment, the heartache,

<h3>
§ 28<a class="pagenum" name="page_099" title="99"> </a></h3>

<p>On the Freedom of the Will may I
quote myself? Matthew Arnold has
given me precedent.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"
href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>"There are just two misleading terms
in that little phrase, the Freedom of the
Will, and these are just the words 'freedom'
and 'will.' There is no such thing
in the bodily frame as a separate entity
or faculty called a 'will' walking about
like a pilot on deck and directing the
course; and, if there were, such pilot
would not be 'free' from the influences
of wind and tide. The bodily frame is
like a ship, with its captain and crew.
The captain has to go by the chart (that
is, by his knowledge and experience of
life), and the crew have to trim the sails
(that is, adapt actions to circumstances).
The captain (that is, the higher coordinating
<a class="pagenum" name="page_100" title="100"> </a>
centres) is not 'free,' for he
is dependent on his crew (to which we
may compare the nerves and the ganglia)&mdash;which,
in turn, are dependent upon
weather (that is, our surroundings). The
captain may 'will' as much as he likes,
but if his crew are mutinous, or the winds
contrary, he will not make port. 'Will
power' at bottom merely means an intelligent
captain and an obedient crew;
and 'putting-forth' or 'exercising' will
power merely means that captain and
crew must work in harmony. So that, if
attention, if virtue, if conduct and character
depend upon will power (as of course
they do), Aristotle seems to be perfectly
right in saying that the secret of these is
&#949;&#958;&#953;&#962;, or habit or practice: only a trained
crew can work the ship."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"

<p>One thing only is certain&mdash;and whether

the certainty derives from a rational or

<span class="smcaps">The Instinct for Walking</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 30</h3>

<p>For many reasons, walking seems to be
an ingrained instinct of mankind. I
cling to the perhaps fanciful theory that
no primitive instinct of man is altogether
lost. It is modified, amplified, refined;
that is all. With all our culture, we
are barbarians still. Man is a clothed
savage. And now and again he delights
in doffing the clothing and returning
heartily to savagery. How delightful
the feel of the briny breeze and the boisterous
wave on the bare pelt! Mr Edward
Carpenter rails at the (I think) eleven
layers of clothing that intervene between
<a class="pagenum" name="page_104" title="104"> </a>
our skins and the airs of heaven. Walt
Whitman revelled nude in his sun bath.
What a treat too, sometimes, to get away
from the multi-coursed dinner and to bite
downright audibly into simple food in the
fresh air, and to lap water noisily from
the brook! Well, walking, perhaps, is the
primal instinct, ancient as Eden, where
the Lord God walked in the garden in
the cool of the day. And, if my theory
is correct, walking will persist till in
recovered Paradise man walks with his
Maker again. No mechanical contrivance
for locomotion will extirpate the
tribe of tramps, of those who walk from
love of walking.</p>

<span class="smcaps">A Woeful Walk</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 31</h3>

<p>But not all walks are occasions of
unmitigated pleasure. By no means. A
certain trudge, which particularly lives
in my memory, was one of almost unmitigated
pain.&mdash;No; I will not say that,

that was! It rained the long day
through, and as we strode westward,
a cold, wet wind from the east blew
hard. The roads were impassable for
mud; the trees were leafless; the fields
bare. Inns there were none, and at
the thirteenth mile I broke a nice big
<a class="pagenum" name="page_106" title="106"> </a>
flask of port wine or e'er a blessed sip of
the liquid (I mean a sip of the blessed
liquid) had passed our lips. A woeful
walk was that, and woeful pedestrians
were we.&mdash;Yet, somehow, it is with the
extremest pleasure that now I recall that
trudge. To beguile the time, and to try
to forget the rain, we improvised a play,
and shouted dialogues as we strode. We
covered forty miles at a stretch; and
whether it was the play, or the fresh air,
or the exercise, or L&mdash;&mdash;'s indomitable
Mark Tapleyism, we limped (no, we
lamely ran the last few yards) into our
destination, in spirits, at least, buoyant,
jubilant, and secure.&mdash;How mad and bad
and sad it was! And oh, how we were
stiff!</p>

<span class="smcaps">Autumn in Canada Again</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 32</h3>

<p>Yet another country walk taken in
England's North American dominions
lives most pleasantly in my memory.</p>

<p>Two of the clock one autumn afternoon
found me free. I had hoped to have lost
no time in beginning to put enormous
stretches of space between me and my
desk. Not that this desk had not its
pleasures, and many of them; but one
craves a change of mental atmosphere,
however salubrious that usually respired.
The temptation, however, of calmly and
in self-righteously indolent manner enjoying
the sweets of freedom was too
<a class="pagenum" name="page_108" title="108"> </a>
strong, so I lounged a whole afternoon,
and not till daybreak on the following
morning was I booted, knapsacked, and
afoot.</p>

<p>The task of putting space between me
and my desk was not one as easy as I had
anticipated. It was hours before the dust
of the city was shaken off, and the mud
of the country allowed to take its place;
the tedium of the streets at that unfrequented
hour of the day made them seem
interminable. For was I not craving
and in search of country sights and
sounds? And yet for miles not one met
the eye or ear. Yes, I am forgetting:
there was one which made up for much
monotony. On a humble cottage wall
facing the south, far out in the suburbs,
was a wealth of flowering convolvulus
such as I had rarely or only in India seen
before. The sight was entrancing. The
<a class="pagenum" name="page_109" title="109"> </a>
various-hued blossoms seemed blatantly
to trumpet forth their beauty to the sun,
to borrow the terms of sound and to apply
them to colour. And what colour was
there! That deep, soft, velvet purple,
powdered with snowy pollen&mdash;what a
profound, what an acute sense it produced
of something altogether beyond the limitations
of time and space, of something
mysterious, beneficent, divine. Never
before did I see so deep a meaning in
those words: "Consider the lilies of the
field, how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin: and yet I say unto
you, That even Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like one of these." How
paltry, how tainted, seemed all human
greatness beside those simple petals;
how marred, how deformed! And why?
Why should Nature alone be able to
smile openly before her Maker's eyes, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_110" title="110"> </a>
man be ever hiding himself from the
presence of the Lord God? Ah! there
is more than one interpretation of the
text, "All have sinned, and come short
of the glory of God." ... Those brilliant
blossoms aroused many a thought. How
earnestly have all poets of Nature striven
to find expression for the emotions that
natural beauty evokes! And yet none
has completely succeeded, and none will
succeed till the hidden links are discovered
between the beautiful thing, the mind
that perceives it, and the Hand that
fashions it. How is it that a sunset, a
landscape, a green field even, or a growing
fern, will sometimes in a moment of time
cause to blaze up in a man a thrill, a joy,
so intense that under its influence one
feels dazed and dumb? A great power
is, as it were, suddenly let loose; beauty
incarnated momentarily reveals its divine
<a class="pagenum" name="page_111" title="111"> </a>
presence, and one feels an all but overwhelming
impulse to yield oneself to
it and be rapt away whithersoever it
leads. But&mdash;whither it leads we cannot
go.</p>

<p>Of all poets who have given utterance
to this deep and mystical emotion, Wordsworth
perhaps has best succeeded. What
can rival the following lines?&mdash;which
will bear constant quotation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">A motion and a spirit, that impels</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_112" title="112"> </a>
If only Wordsworth had written oftener
in that strain of higher mood! To me
this passage, even with just such narrow
meaning as one not worthy to call himself
a Wordsworthian can read into it, has
been invaluable. In the mass of that
hidden, cloudy, inner signification with
which (I think it is Mr Ruskin who insists
that) all poetry should be instinct, these
lines are marvellous. They more nearly
reach the goal of that "struggle to conceive
the inconceivable, to utter the
unutterable, that longing after the Infinite,
that love of God," which Professor
Max Müller describes as the basis of all
religions, than all the creeds such religions
have constructed.</p>

<p>Wordsworth saw, as perhaps no one
before him ever quite so clearly saw, the
Spiritual Unity underlying those two
things:&mdash;the one called External Nature;
<a class="pagenum" name="page_113" title="113"> </a>
the other, this spark of life called the
Human Soul&mdash;the product of, and burning
in, that External Nature, as a flame
feeds upon the air which it illumines.&mdash;But
to return to my walk.</p>

<h3>
§ 33</h3>

<p>Curiously enough, I had hardly reached
the confines of the town which I was
leaving before I fell in with a youth
apparently possessed of the same motive
as myself&mdash;namely, to enjoy to the full
the delights of the country after a year's
inclusion in a thronged city; and, in order
the better to do so, to use as means of
locomotion his own two legs, and a stout
stick. I say "apparently," for very
short converse with him revealed the fact
that he was utterly blind to the charms
of Nature. He was nice-mannered and
polite to a degree; but as a companion
<a class="pagenum" name="page_114" title="114"> </a>
to aid in discovering rural beauty he was
simply worse than none at all. His two
negative or denominatorial eyes and ears
completely cancelled, made useless, and
altogether put out of existence my two
positive or numeratorial senses. I was
prepared to take infinite delight in the
most trivial and insignificant of Nature's
works, to extol her most commonplace
manifestations, to find the longest sermons
in the tiniest pebbles; but to do this by
the side of the most antipathetic of, to
all intents and purposes, blind and deaf
of fellow-pedestrians&mdash;it was out of the
question. I nothing extenuate nor set
down aught in malice when I say that
that utterance of his most pregnant with
observation of the passing scene was contained
in the words, "That's a potato-patch!"
The early morning sun fought
its way between dense grey clouds, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_115" title="115"> </a>
fell in cheering light on the tops of the
trees, and in silver showers on the gleaming
lake below; the rich green meadows
caught the rays, the very air seemed
laden with treasures of sunlight; young
and graceful maples, in crimson autumn
tints, like Mænads at vintage-time, flung
flaming torches towards the sky, unmindful
of the morn; the sumach and the
gorgeous virginia-creeper were ablaze with
beauty; yet of all this he saw nothing;
a brown potato-patch by the highway
rim a brown potato-patch was to him, and
it was nothing more. Yes, by the by, it
was something more: it was an appreciable
piece of property, a prospective
town lot at so much per foot frontage,
one-third cash down and the balance in
half-yearly instalments to suit the purchaser,
all local improvements paid by....
At least some such jargon caught my
<a class="pagenum" name="page_116" title="116"> </a>
inattentive ear. Real estate is, I gladly
grant, a topic of (often too) absorbing
interest; but one does not exactly wish
to be confronted with intricate monetary
calculations, connected with barter and
commerce, when engaged in the not very
kindred and decidedly delicate task of
wooing Nature. Barter and commerce
when Wordsworth is ringing in one's ears,
incorporated companies and syndicates
when bird and bush ask your attention&mdash;these
things, in the language of the
pharmacop&oelig;ia, are incompatibles.</p>

<h3>
§ 34</h3>

<p>I had thus two causes of complaint
against my companion. So I left him:
I took a bypath; he kept to the highway.
Nor was I sorry. It is pleasant
now and again for short periods to get
away from one's fellow-men. Familiarity
<a class="pagenum" name="page_117" title="117"> </a>
breeds contempt, it is said; perhaps
it is as true of aggregations of men as of
individuals. At all events, one comes
back from a temporary seclusion with
a sweeter temper, a more kindly and
tolerant regard for those about one. Nor
was I sorry. The main road contained
too many curious starers. To walk for
pleasure was a thing wholly outside the
limits of their comprehension. "'Tisn't
'cause 'tis cheaper?" asked one irrepressible
inquirer (always this matter of
money!); and he was still more puzzled
at the explanation that hotel bills largely
exceeded railway fare....</p>

<h3>
§ 35</h3>

<p>Yet one seeks entertainment when
travelling long alone. The mind becomes
overfull, it gathers from every sight and
sound and scent, and craves another mind
<a class="pagenum" name="page_118" title="118"> </a>
as depositary for the surplus, as sharer
of the spoils. In time also it wearies of
constant observation, and would give
much for a companion. In lieu of a concrete
one, I found myself quite unconsciously
imitating Macaulay, and substituting
an abstract one by quoting
Milton; and never did his ponderous yet
marvellously poised lines sound to me so
grand as when rolled <i>ore rotundo</i> to the
accompaniment of Ontario's rolling wave.
M. Henri Cochin, Matthew Arnold tells
us, speaks of "the majestic English
iambic." It is to Milton surely that
the English iambic owes the praise of
majesty. To me, I confess, the exceeding
beauty of much of Milton's verse is
a snare&mdash;as is also much of Mr Ruskin's
prose: the ear is so captivated by the
sound that the mind strays from the
sense.</p>


<h3>
§ 36<a class="pagenum" name="page_119" title="119"> </a></h3>

<p>Toronto was my starting point, and my
course lay eastwards on the northern
shore of great Lake Ontario by what is
always known as the Kingston Road, one
of the oldest in the country, the precursor
of the Grand Trunk Railway, the track of
which, indeed, it closely follows. The
country through which it runs varies but
little in scenery, being a great undulating
stretch of fertile land thickly settled
with farms and orchards, and as thickly
wooded with pine, maple, larch, elm, fir,
beech, hickory, and other trees common
in Canada. Here and there a small river
runs to the lake, and here and there the
shore rises into cliffs of eighty or a
hundred feet. Cows and sheep, and pigs
and poultry, meet one all along the road,
showing us the occupations of the inhabitants;
<a class="pagenum" name="page_120" title="120"> </a>
as do also the fields of barley
and wheat, and the great orchards gay
with the unrivalled Canadian apple, which
gleams at us from the boughs with every
hue and size. The Kingston Road is a
king's highway with a vengeance; hard,
well-travelled, and dotted, I should say,
along its whole length, with comfortable,
often elaborate, habitations standing in
the midst of fields and trees. At every
ten, fifteen, twenty, or thirty miles these
habitations cluster into villages or towns;
sometimes where road and railway intersect,
when there spring up factories and
warehouses; sometimes down by the shore,
when there rise elevators and wharves.
I cannot pretend to say that these are
interesting. They consist for the most
part each of one straggling main street,
itself a part of the Kingston Road, and
differentiated from it only by the unkempt
<a class="pagenum" name="page_121" title="121"> </a>
habitations that line its length, and by the
inevitable wooden pavements, broad in
the central portions, but narrowing to a
single plank in the outskirts&mdash;where, no
doubt, it was in reality, if not in name,
the "Lovers' Walk." They were not
quaint, no ancient and few historical
traditions clung to them, neither did they
appear to me to possess any distinguishing
characteristics.</p>

<h3>
§ 37</h3>

<p>I have spoken of a quiet country town.
A country town of a Sunday afternoon in
Canada is the quietest of existing things.
Everything in it seems lifeless. Not a
sound is heard from any side. One's own
cough startles one in the very streets.
Two cows slowly wend their way homewards;
an over-ripe apple falls heavily
in an unkempt front garden&mdash;even these
<a class="pagenum" name="page_122" title="122"> </a>
signs of semi-life are a relief. Rows of
youths, all dressed in sombre black, and
all smoking cigars fearfully if not wonderfully
made, lean against the walls of the
inn at the corner, or stand in silent knots
about the horse-gnawed "hitching-post."
The jaded afternoon sunlight falls slantingly
and weariedly on untidy plots in
which weeds strive for mastery successfully
with flowers, on empty verandahs
with blistered paint, on the dusty grass
encroaching ever on the street. I enter
the inn. It is chilly, and in the common
room which serves many purposes a
battered stove lacking two-thirds of its
mica radiates a dry and suffocating heat.
On deal chairs, mostly tipped up, sit the
youths but just now lounging without.
They say nothing; only they sit and
smoke, and spit&mdash;how they spit! They
themselves probably are all unconscious
<a class="pagenum" name="page_123" title="123"> </a>
of the incessant salivary sharp-shooting;
but I&mdash;I sit in terror, like a nervous
woman dreading the pistol shots on the
stage. Soon church bells begin to clang.
None heeds them, nor are they over-inviting;
one is cracked, they are not in
harmony, and they seem to be ringing a
race in which the hindmost is to win.
In the space of about an hour, however,
the youths begin to move, as if with the
feeling that at last will come a small
relief from the awful <i>ennui</i> which they
cannot express. Church is coming out.
They go out and draw up before the doors.
A heavy yellow light streams across the
street, and with it issues an odour,
perhaps, of sanctity, but much disguised
by kerosene. Greetings follow between
the out-coming damsels and the waiting
youths, and curious raucous laughs intended
to be tender are heard disappearing
<a class="pagenum" name="page_124" title="124"> </a>
into darkened ways. Soon all is
again hushed, and but for here and there
the slow and lugubrious sounds of hymn
tunes played on old and middle-aged
organs, the little town might be a buried
city of the East.</p>

<h3>
§ 38</h3>

<p>Yet no doubt it had its tragedies, this
seemingly peaceful and sequestered spot:
indeed signs of most pathetic tragedies
came under my own eyes, few as were the
hours which I spent in it. Hanging about
the unpretentious hostelry about which
those uncouth youths gathered, were two
specimens of what was once humanity
that made the heart ache to look on. One
was a case, I think, hopeless: a gaunt and
dirty figure, his last drink still dripping
from his beard, clothed in the vilest of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_125" title="125"> </a>
shirts, and in things that were once
trousers, which last hung loose over large
and faded carpet slippers, he moved disgust
as well as pity. The other was of a
different class. Drink had been his bane
also, but there was not in his face that
absence of all shame, that despair merging
into careless defiance, which stamped his
fellow-sufferer's case as beyond the cure of
man. They called him "Doc," and there
were still evidences of birth and education
upon his bloated features. What had
driven him thus far? I could not help
but conjecture. Was there a woman at
the bottom of it? If so, where and what
was she now? Somebody else's....
But this was idle guesswork. There was
yet another case, a woman herself this
time, still more tragic. Her motto,
stamped upon every feature, expressed in
every gesture, was "The heart knoweth
<a class="pagenum" name="page_126" title="126"> </a>
its own bitterness." A tall, dark, and
once handsome spinster, a <i>femme de
trente ans</i>, she waited upon us at table;
but with such an air of utter indifference,
with such complete abstraction from
things material and ephemeral, that she
awed the very persons to whose wants she
ministered. Her face wore a settled and
unaltering expression of something missed
yet never to that day for one moment
forgotten. A machine could not have
carried plates and moved dishes with more
unfailing stolidity. Her thoughts were
remotely away in the past, and it seemed
as if nothing, nothing upon all this earth,
could fetch them back. Cato's statue
would have smiled as soon as she. It was
pathetic in the extreme. One longed to
give her if but one moment's peace of
mind. Did she <i>never</i> forget? What was
it she brooded on? How long would the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_127" title="127"> </a>
feminine heart and brain stand that
strain? Tragedies! Yes, there were
tragedies there, as everywhere else.</p>

<h3>
§ 39</h3>

<p>Such is Sunday in a country town.
But in truth, after the rush and hurry of
city life, in the country it seems always
Sunday. There is a leisure, a calm, a
restfulness, and, away by the fields, a
quiet sanctity which pervades its every
part and unconsciously influences its
every inhabitant. By degrees, too, on
the traveller through the country this
calming influence comes. The still green
meadows, the gently swaying boughs, the
sunshine sleeping pillowed on the clouds&mdash;all
tend to meditative and restful peace,
and one reaps the harvest of a quiet eye.
And if one yields to this beneficent mood
<a class="pagenum" name="page_128" title="128"> </a>
there is much, very much, to be gained.
Alone with Nature, all around the spacious
earth, above the immeasurable heavens,
alone in a vast expanse, one finds oneself,
in Amiel's fine phrase, <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
the Infinite. At such times the great
problem of Life flares upon us like a flash
of lightning, so sudden, so intense, so
vivid is its irruption on the mental vision.
Time and space, like the darkness of night,
are annihilated, earthly bounds are burst,
and there is revealed a realm of Being
beyond the confines of the relative, the
limited, the finite. We recognise the
infinity of unity, the brotherhood of all
things. Terms of proportion and comparison
lose their significance: there is
no great or little, important or trivial, for
the minutest object is an essential part of
the All, without which this All would
cease to be.</p>


<h3>
§ 40<a class="pagenum" name="page_129" title="129"> </a></h3>

<p>Curious thoughts, or "half-embodyings
of thoughts" as Coleridge called them,
that lonely walk aroused. What <i>was</i> this
All? And what portion of this All was
I&mdash;I, this tiny biped crawling ant-like
between earth and sky? I looked over
the flat earth, and remembered that it was
not flat but round, and but one of myriads
like itself, and among them, perhaps, as
paltry as, upon it, I. I looked up at the
sky, filled with the radiance of the sun,
and again remembered that, sown through
space like seed, were countless other suns,
and ours perhaps the least in all that host.
And when night came, and the stars shone,
I remembered that even then I saw only
what came in at the pin-prick of the eye,
and that to the mighty All that myriad-studded
sky was perhaps as trivial as to
<a class="pagenum" name="page_130" title="130"> </a>
it was earth or sun. Yet, trivial as we
were, we were not naught&mdash;not quite
nothing. That was the wonder of it.
So far from naught, indeed, that to me,
this tiny biped crawling, himself was very
important; his little pains, his aches, even
these his questionings were very real. If
incommensurable suns swung high overhead,
he at least was the centre of his own
little world, and not the most astounding
facts of science could alter or remove that
egocentric view.&mdash;And, if not nothing, if
something in all that vast inane, then
what? How came it that, prompted by
what entered at that pin-prick eye, something
within him could fling itself, fling
itself faster than light, far beyond the
outermost boundary of vision, and put to
the immensity of Being questions which,
could Being hear, would surely put it to
the blush? Those pains, those aches,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_131" title="131"> </a>
were they nothing to the All? To the
tiny mighty atom they were much.&mdash;But
the world spun round, and the sun set, and
darkness was upon the face of the deep.</p>

<h3>
§ 41</h3>

<p>It is well now and again, I think, to
withdraw into the holy of holies of one's
own self, "where dwells the Nameless,"<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"
href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
in its shapeless and vague impenetrability,
"as a cloud." The world is too much
with us. The myriad trivial details of
everyday life hide from us that of which
they ought in reality perpetually to remind
us. For, after all, what is all action,
even as manifested in these trivial details,
but a struggle to overcome space and time,
the limitations of the finite; and what,
again, is all thought but a struggle to
conceive the infinite?</p>


<h3>
§ 42<a class="pagenum" name="page_132" title="132"> </a></h3>

<p>Yet another thought this spacious
prospect gave me. The endless green
fields and the endless blue lake seemed a
symbol of the unrealisability of the ideal.
With both I was enamoured, and with
the beauty of both I craved in some dim
and unknown way to take my fill of
delight: both were at my feet, but both
stretched away and away until they met
the eternal and unapproachable heavens
at the horizon. Yes, the fields were green,
but not the spot on which I stood; the
water was blue, but not in the cup with
which I tried to assuage my thirst.&mdash;But
there is a limit to ontological and psychological
speculations of sombre hue.</p>

XX<a class="pagenum" name="page_133" title="133"> </a><br/>
<span class="smcaps">The Walking Tour</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 43</h3>

<p>Up to the present we have considered
the country walk only. The walking trip
or tour is a more serious affair. If it
requires as vacuous a frame of mind, it
necessitates a more deliberate preparation.
Much depends upon the country and the
locality chosen. If inviting hostelries
abound, one needs to weight oneself with
little; if they are infrequent, or nonexistent,
food and clothing become matters
of moment. This may sound a truism;
but it is a truism that many a tripper
wishes he had laid more earnestly to heart
when, miles from house and home, he
<a class="pagenum" name="page_134" title="134"> </a>
finds himself wet, hungry, and fatigued.
It is better to carry a few extra pounds
far than to run short soon; for a worn-out
body means a useless mind, and hunger
and cold, with their attendant depression
of spirits, not only rob the tour of its
pleasure, but rob the tourist of his zest.
Start, therefore, comfortable, and comfortably
provided. This is not Sybaritism;
it is common-sense.</p>

<p>For an extended trip, send on some
luggage ahead, if you can; and some
money (I speak of civilised regions). It
is impossible, if you are alone&mdash;unless,
like Stevenson, you hire a donkey&mdash;to
transport on your own back food and
clothing to keep you going for more than
a few days at a stretch&mdash;unless you shoot,
or fish, or trap&mdash;which is sport or prospecting,
not walking.</p>

<p>Your first care should be for your feet&mdash;another
<a class="pagenum" name="page_135" title="135"> </a>
truism not seldom neglected.
See that your boots fit&mdash;<i>fit</i>, remembering
that the feet swell (I speak to tenderfoots).</p>

<p>If you are unaccustomed to walking,
a good plan is to start with an extra
pair of leather soles inside your boots.
These can be taken out when the feet
swell.</p>

<p>If you prefer shoes to boots, wear gaiters
or putties&mdash;to keep out the wet in winter,
to keep out the dust in summer. The
only occasion upon which I suffered from
blisters was on a sixty-mile walk in tennis
shoes on a dusty road in August. Take
two or three changes of socks. If you
walk in a populous region, carry a pair of
light shoes. These will come in handy if
you run across a friend who asks you to
dinner. Carry also a collar or two; not
only hosts and hostesses, but landlords and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_136" title="136"> </a>
landladies look askance at too trampish
an appearance. I once felt rather uncomfortable
sitting at the head of a table
d'hôte at the excellent Hôtel Kaltenbach
on the American side at Niagara
(the landlord knew me well), for I was in
rough flannels and tweeds, and my fellow-guests
were dressed like (and some of them
probably were) millionaires and millionairesses.
<i>Verbum sapientibus satis.</i>&mdash;Do
not refuse an invitation to dinner. Follow
Napoleon's advice and let the country
you pass through support you, falling
back upon your own food-supply when
necessary. Help yourself to as much
fruit as you can, or as the owners
thereof and their dogs permit. A too
concentrated diet is unwholesome. Expatiate
upon this to the owners of
orchards, and&mdash;back your theories with
a dole.</p>


<h3>
§ 44<a class="pagenum" name="page_137" title="137"> </a></h3>

<p>But nothing equals the evening meal
cooked over your own fire&mdash;if you are
not too tired to cook it. Of the cookery
I shall speak later; but the fire is as invigorating
as the food. Would you taste
the consummation of human masculine
contentment, stretch your tired legs before
your own fire after a long, long walk
followed by a full meal: your chamber,
the forest primæval, green, indistinct in
the twilight; your couch, the scented
earth; your canopy, the heavens, curtained
with clouds; in your nostrils the incense
of burning wood; in your heart the peace
which the world giveth not.&mdash;The elaborately
ornamented modern hearth, with
its carved oak or its sculptured marble, is
the direct lineal descendant of the nomad
fire&mdash;the earliest institution of man, the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_138" title="138"> </a>
first promoter of civilisation, the binder-together
of troglodytic families into
tribes. "Hearth and Home" is an
ancient, a very ancient, sentiment. It
dates back, I take it, to the Glacial Epoch&mdash;far
enough, in all conscience.&mdash;In my
mind's eye I see the shivering Cave-man,
appalled at the encroaching ice, the
deepening cold. He gathers wood,
huddles him in caves, the drops from his
furry, ill-smelling clothing (there was no
tanning then) sputtering in the flames.
For self-protection, and from lack of fuel,
family makes alliance with family, and
the first-formed human community squats
silent about the first-formed human
hearth. What friendships must have
there been cemented, what tales told;
what a strange first unburthening of
human heart to human heart! What
ecstatic love-making, too, must have
<a class="pagenum" name="page_139" title="139"> </a>
been enacted in the darksome corners of
the sooty cave, the while the grey gorged
hunters snored, and toothless beldames
gesticulated dumb-crambo scandal by the
smouldering brands!&mdash;No wonder præhistoric
associations cluster even now
about what is too often represented by a
flamboyant mantelpiece with immaculate
tiles and polished brasses. <i>Pro Aris
et Focis!</i> The smoking altar is the
consecrated symbol of the lowly hearth.</p>

<h3>
§ 45</h3>

<p>As to food&mdash;bacon, flour, and beans are
the stand-by. The curious in the matter
of concentrated and portable foods will
do well to consult Nansen's elaborate and
carefully calculated lists of these.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"
href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Carry
some chocolate: it staves off hunger and
is nourishing. Milk, if you can get it, has
wonderful staying powers, and by most
people&mdash;especially under stress of prolonged
exertion&mdash;is easily digested.
Wear wool next the skin, and wear it
loose. Let everything be loose. And
<a class="pagenum" name="page_141" title="141"> </a>
see that your tailor puts pockets&mdash;deep
and wide ones&mdash;in every conceivable and
inconceivable part of your costume. As
to books, sketching or writing materials,
or a camera&mdash;every tramp has his hobby:
indulge yours to the full; what are you
walking for if not to enjoy life? Lastly,
do not forget that, if you are not far
from the haunts of men, you will over
and over again be indebted to your fellow-men
for little kindnesses and civilities.
A pocketful of small change will make
many a rough place smooth. I might
mention also <i>sotto voce</i> that so will a flask
of good whisky. To these you may add
a couple of bandages, some chlorodyne,
a few ounces of cognac, a small styptic,
a needle and some thread, a small razor,
and a cake of soap. Also, if you wear
an eye-glass or glasses, by no means
forget to carry some extra ones. As for
<a class="pagenum" name="page_142" title="142"> </a>
the rest, a pipe, a very big pouch of
tobacco (many will dip into it), a stout
stick, and abundance of matches ought
to make you independent of everything
and everybody for days together.</p>

<h3>
§ 46</h3>

<p>A word, too, on beverages, which are
as important as is food.&mdash;Eschew alcohol
in every shape or form, unless you are
dog-tired at the end of a long day and
must make a few miles ere nightfall.
Alcoholic stimulation spells ruination
to muscular exertion the moment the
stimulus has passed off. It was said
that on the march to the relief of Ladysmith
in the South African War the
drinkers could be told as plainly as if
they had been labelled.</p>

<p>The best example I know of the wise
and efficacious use of alcohol is in Edith
<a class="pagenum" name="page_143" title="143"> </a>
Elmer Wood's "An Oberland Chalet."
The author, her sister-in-law, and her
brother, with a guide, were climbing the
Strahlegg Pass.</p>

<p>"All the way up that eight hundred
feet of rock wall, there was never a ledge
large enough to rest on with the entire
two feet at once!... The numbness of
my hands was so great that my control
over them was most uncertain. My life
and that of my companions depended on
the grip I should keep with those cramped,
aching fingers, but though I concentrated
my will power on them I felt no certainty
that the next minute they would not
become rigid and refuse to obey me....
After the first few minutes, I never looked
downward. I was not inclined to dizziness,
but the drop was too appalling....
Once we got all four on a little ledge not
as wide as the length of our feet, but solid
enough to stand on without balancing.
We paused there to take breath, and
somebody said 'Cognac.' Now our experience
<a class="pagenum" name="page_144" title="144"> </a>
in the Alpine hut the night
before had nearly made teetotalers of us.
But at this moment we decided that
stimulants might have a legitimate use.
Frater produced his silver pocket flask
and handed it round. We took a swallow
in turn, and it was like liquid life running
down our throats. I never experienced
anything so magical.... I was at the
very last point of endurance. I had lost
faith in ever reaching the summit of the
cliff. I had no more physical force with
which to lift my sagging weight upward.
I had lost the will power that lashes on
an exhausted body. My numb hands
were stiffening. My lungs were choked
and labouring. I could neither go on
nor go back. Then those two teaspoonfuls,
or thereabouts, of fiery cognac that
burned down my throat sufficed to give
me back my grip on myself, physical and
mental. I moved my cramped fingers
and they answered. I took a deep
long breath and felt strengthened. A
hope, almost a confidence, crept into
<a class="pagenum" name="page_145" title="145"> </a>
my heart that we might reach the top
alive."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"
href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<h3>
§ 47</h3>

<p>The best all-round stimulant is tea.
I say it advisedly, knowing full well that
to Dr Alexander Haig and the anti-uric-acid
dietists tea is Anathema Maranatha.
But every mining prospector, every railroad
constructor, every lumberman, every
out-in-the-wilds worker throughout
Australia and America drinks tea&mdash;proof,
surely, that it is efficacious, even if it be
in a sense deleterious. In huge quantities,
and constantly taken, I dare say
it is deleterious. But personally I know
of no pick-me-up preferable to tea, when,
cold, hungry, and tired at the end of a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_146" title="146"> </a>
long day's tramp, you find yourself "all
in" and unable to eat.</p>

<p>I recall an instance of the extraordinary
efficacy of tea&mdash;quite weak, but hot. It
was at the end of a forty-mile walk through
a monotonous country in cold, wind, and
rain. We arrived tired out; and although
we knew we were hungry (for we
had had precious little to eat all day),
the thought of food was repulsive, though
the restaurant we had reached displayed
a variety of viands. I ordered hot tea
in the biggest teapot procurable. It
was brought. We sipped I forget how
many cups each. Then we supped indeed;
and after supper one of the party
proposed to walk the forty miles back!</p>

<hr />

<p>Perhaps Dr Haig will say that plain
hot water would have done just as well.
Humph! Give me weak, but good, tea.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_147" title="147"> </a>
Hot milk, of course, is an incomparable
pick-me-up. But who, on a trudge, can
always, by demanding it, obtain hot
milk? If you can get it, milk, in any
shape or form, is unrivalled. More than
once it has raised me from the depths
of low spirits, produced by hunger and
thirst and fatigue, to the most contented
of moods.&mdash;I was walking once on a hot
summer's day along a barren and dusty
road where was no habitation nor signs
of men. My knapsack was empty, so
was my water-bottle. Not a brook or a
stream could I find. It was late in the
day. I was heart-sick and weary. But
the miracle happened. Did I believe my
eyes, or was that a man there milking cows
over yonder in that field? I made
straight for him, and, after passing the
time of day and being generally polite
(the while my tongue clave to my palate),
<a class="pagenum" name="page_148" title="148"> </a>
I presently asked if I might have some of
his priceless liquid&mdash;I called it simply
"milk." Genially he pointed to a pail&mdash;<i>a
pail</i>, and bade me help myself. I
put that vessel to my lips, and I rather
think that the vertical arc described by
any given point on the periphery of the
bottom of that utensil during the process
of deglutition was not a small one!
When I put that pail down (and a twenty-five-cent
piece beside it) I was a new
man, and laughed at miles and melancholy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Very often, when walking, especially
in hot weather, one finds oneself tired
when only a few miles have been covered.
It is not real fatigue; it is want of fluid.
The skin exudes moisture; the blood
thickens; the serums and synovial fluids
run short; waste matter is not excreted;
<a class="pagenum" name="page_149" title="149"> </a>
the muscles and tendons require
lubrication. A copious draught of water
will put all to rights. Not everyone knows
this. I myself owe the hint to a friend.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"
href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h3>
§ 48</h3>

<p>Each walker must, however, discover
for himself what is the food best suited
to his needs&mdash;remembering always that
it is quite possible to spoil a whole day
by even trivial dietetic mistakes. If you
walk to see and to enjoy, unless you
possess that youth which can digest anything,
and that vitality which can attack
anything, take heed as to what you eat
and what you attempt.&mdash;Most unfortunate
is the remembrance of an otherwise
lovely walk I took one day over one of
the most lovely of the passes of the Jura.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_150" title="150"> </a>
The day was superb; the road by the
soft green pastures was superb; and
superb was the climb through the tangled
brushwood of the slopes. Filmy clouds
formed themselves to leeward of the peaks
and hid the tops of the pines; above, I
gazed into a deep blue sky; beneath,
I gazed into a deep green vale; and a
tumbling brook sent its music up the
heights. But&mdash;I had started foodless,
and had stuffed into my pockets only a
stodgy roll and a box of sardines. By
noon I was hungry. I finished the roll
<i>and</i> the sardines. With deplorable result.
The pancreas rebelled, the senses were
dulled, and all the beauties of the Jura
were lost upon <i>heu me miserum</i>!&mdash;Fellow-tramp,
take thought for your provender&mdash;and
provender good old Dr Johnson
defines as "dry food for brutes."&mdash;<i>That</i>
is the diet to walk on.</p>


<h3>
§ 49<a class="pagenum" name="page_151" title="151"> </a></h3>

<p>But, after all, one's impedimenta must
be chosen according to one's tastes. Mr
Hilaire Belloc equipped himself for his
seven-hundred-mile walk from Toul to
Rome with "a large piece of bread, half-a-pound
of smoked ham, a sketch-book,
two Nationalist papers, and a quart of
the wine of Brulé"<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"
href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (but one halfpennyworth
of bread to this intolerable
deal of sack!); though farther on he
tells us he also carried "a needle, some
thread, and a flute."<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"
href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But then Mr
Belloc's path lay through thickly-peopled
districts; he rarely slept in the open;
travelled in summer-time; and not once,
I think, lighted a fire: and certes he
reached Rome in sorry plight.</p>

<h3>
§ 50</h3>

<p>And now for some hints on the practical
details of walking tours of more arduous
character and more extended length.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"
href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;Suit
the weight of your knapsack or pack
to your strength, leaving a large margin
for comfort. If you travel in regions
uninhabited by man, and the climate
is rigorous, a shelter at night is all-important.
Therefore carry a light
blanket: a warm head and face induce
sleep; so does a change to dry underclothing
at the end of the day. For really
<a class="pagenum" name="page_153" title="153"> </a>
hard trips, when you walk all day and
walk far, you will need, to replace used-up
muscular tissue, each day:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">&frac34; lb. of flour;</div>
    <div class="verse">&frac34; lb. of bacon;</div>
    <div class="verse">&frac12; lb. of beans;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent0">&mdash;and to these you should add dried fruit
or rice. The best dried fruit is a mixture
in equal parts of apricots and prunes.
Take an abundance of tea: nothing takes
the place of tea; and supply yourself
with pepper, salt, sugar, candles, and
soap. Your cooking pots should fit the
one into the other. These things, with
a small frying-pan, an axe (to cut poles
for your evening shelter and wood for
your fire), a file to sharpen this, and some
stout wire hooks by which to hang your
pots over the fire, complete, I think, the
sum-total of your absolutely necessary
impedimenta.</p>


<h3>
§ 51<a class="pagenum" name="page_154" title="154"> </a></h3>

<p>The sedulous, however sage, have little
idea how large a part of active life depends
on food. To stay-at-homes, who go down
to the dining-room when the gong sounds,
a meal seems a mere incident of life, an
intermission from work, an opportunity
for a family chat. The traveller on foot
soon learns that a meal is of the most
vital importance. Every reader of
Nansen's thrilling narrative must have
noticed this. Even in Mr Belloc's literary
"Path to Rome" one is struck with
the intrusion of this unliterary topic, and
the more literary "Inland Voyage" of
Robert Louis Stevenson is not free from
it. While even in that delightful, and delightfully
feminine, "An Oberland Chalet,"
which I have already cited, although the
foods were generally cheese or cakes or
<a class="pagenum" name="page_155" title="155"> </a>
<i>petits pains</i>, and the drinks chocolate or
milk or <i>café au lait</i>, the mention of edibles
and potables is frequent.</p>

<p>The importance of a supply of food has
so often been borne in upon me that I
am inclined to believe that the political
community is coæval with the pantry.
Even amongst animals, only those form
commonwealths which form common
stores of food&mdash;as the ant and the bee.</p>

<p>The pedestrian gains a practical insight
into this wide-reaching influence of a
storage of food. Not for half-a-dozen
hours can he subsist before its importance
is impressed upon him by most painful
pangs. If, therefore, sedulous sage, you
set out on a long hard walk without due
provision for the allaying of hunger, you
will come to grief. I make no apologies,
accordingly, for minute instructions on
that topic here.</p>


<h3>
§ 52<a class="pagenum" name="page_156" title="156"> </a></h3>

<p>The bread of the Western prospector,
my fraternal informant tells me, is
the bannock. Dost know how to make
a bannock? You must have with you
a bag containing flour (of the highest
grade, made from hard wheat), baking
powder, and salt, thoroughly mixed beforehand.
(Use twice as much baking
powder as the instructions on the tin
direct. Half a cupful of salt will suffice
for ten pounds of flour.) Open this bag,
and make a depression in the contents
with your fist. Into this pour a cupful
of water. Stir the sides of the depression
into the water till you get a stiff
dough. Spread this dough in a clean
greased frying-pan. Hold the pan over
the fire till the under side of the dough
is slightly browned, then take the pan
<a class="pagenum" name="page_157" title="157"> </a>
off the fire and set it up on edge to allow
the top of the bannock to toast, and
your bannock is made&mdash;and very delicious
you will find it if you are hungry,
and hungry you certainly will be.</p>

<p>Beans are a more troublesome affair,
for, unfortunately, they take from two
to four hours to boil. But beans are
the mainstay of life on a tour. There are
two good varieties: the small white, and
the larger brown. Take both, and before
starting clean them thoroughly from
dust and grit and stones&mdash;thoroughly.
As soon as your fire is lighted, put on your
beans in cold water with no salt, and keep
them boiling. As soon as they show signs
of softening, add a piece of bacon or a ham
bone and some pepper and salt. When
ready&mdash;eat. If they are not ready for
you when you are ready for them (and
this coincidence is, alas, rare with beans),
<a class="pagenum" name="page_158" title="158"> </a>
the pot should be filled up with water,
the remains of the fire raked into a circle,
in the centre of which the pot should be
kept for the night: they will then make
a dish for breakfast, when they may be
eaten as they are, or can be fried. If
drained fairly dry, they may be carried
as they are and used for luncheon.&mdash;But
the best thing is to make a bannock of
them. Take a clean frying-pan with
plenty of bacon fat in it, and mash the
already boiled beans in this with a fork.
Heat, with stirring, till the mass is dry
enough to set; then fry on both sides.
This will keep for days, "and is," says
my authority, "the finest food I know
of for emergency trips."</p>

<span class="smcaps">The Beauty of Landscape</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 53</h3>

<p>May I here request the reader to accompany
me in a short digression?&mdash;Few
things are pleasanter than a walk in
which one turns down any lane that
invites.</p>

<p>One of the first delights of walking is the
pleasure derived from the passing scene.&mdash;What
is the secret of the pleasure derived
from a beautiful landscape&mdash;or, as a
matter of fact, from almost any landscape?
For apparently a landscape need
not be actually beautiful in order to give
pleasure. "I wouldn't give a mile of the
dear old Sierras," says Bret Harte, "with
<a class="pagenum" name="page_160" title="160"> </a>
their honesty, sincerity, and magnificent
uncouthness, for 100,000 kilomètres of the
picturesque Vaud."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"
href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> And even Mary
MacLane, rail as she did at the barren
sands of Butte, Montana, in her "Story,"<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"
href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
when she left them wrote, "I love those
things the best of all."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"
href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>&mdash;Bret Harte and
Mary MacLane may give us a clue to the
secret. It is not merely the contour or the
colours of a landscape that delight; it is
the associations that cling to it.&mdash;But
what of a scene which is quite new to
the eyes? Still, I think, association.
"Scenery soon palls," says George
Borrow, "unless it is associated with
remarkable events, and the names of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_161" title="161"> </a>
remarkable men."<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"
href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And Ruskin, you
will remember, when gazing at the broken
masses of pine forest which skirt the
course of the Ain above the village of
Champignole, in the Jura, found that the
impressiveness of the scene owed its
source to the fact that "those ever-springing
flowers and ever-flowing streams
had been dyed by the deep colours of
human endurance, valour, and virtue."<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"
href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Packed away in the brain and mind of
man must be subtle and secret memories
dating back through unknown ages of
time.&mdash;A gaseous theory, perhaps, but
one which Senancour has liquefied into
the pellucid sentence:&mdash;"La nature sentie
n'est que dans les rapports humains, et
l'éloquence des choses n'est rien que
<a class="pagenum" name="page_162" title="162"> </a>
l'éloquence de l'homme."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"
href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The great
fight for life, the stern joys of life&mdash;the
ferocious combat, the thrilling love
match, the myriad sensations and emotions
evoked by man's physical environment,
and his struggle for existence
therein&mdash;surely these live somehow somewhere
packed away in his brain to-day&mdash;just
as some migratory and nidificatory
memories must be packed away in the
brain of a bird. It is these dormant
cosmic memories that a landscape revives.
On how many a plain to-day does there
not flow veritable human blood remuted
into sap!&mdash;Terrene Nature was man's
ancestral home and no man can gaze
upon it unmoved.</p>

should be enacted by youths and damsels,
not in secluded groves amidst perfumed
and amorous blooms, but in ball-rooms
and boudoirs.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"

§ 55</h3>

<p>It is a complex, it is a profound enigma,
this of the appeal of the beauty of nature
<a class="pagenum" name="page_165" title="165"> </a>
to the senses and emotions of man. For
Beauty, we must remember, is not an
attribute of the external thing. Beauty
is in the soul that feels, the mind that
thinks, the memory that remembers.
<i>That</i> is beautiful which brings to mind
and memory and soul, ecstatic thrill,
exalted feeling. <i>That</i> is beautiful which
makes for the preservation and propagation
and (which should make for the)
elevation of the race.&mdash;And this is why
Beauty is of various kinds. There is a
Beauty of the senses, and there is a beauty
of the soul&mdash;as there is a terrestrial
Aphrodite, and an Aphrodite uranian.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"
href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Though why the earthly and the heavenly
Aphrodites should not join hands, I do
not know. Perhaps it is only when they
do join hands&mdash;when there is at one and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_166" title="166"> </a>
the same time a spiritual obsession and
a physical oblation&mdash;that Beauty becomes
transfigured before us, reveals her divine
nature radiant through fleshly vestments.
Ah! this occurs only when we are on the
Mount.</p>

<h3>
§ 56</h3>

<p>After all, did John Ruskin really get to
the bottom of this matter of the appeal
of Nature to the heart of man? Is the
beauty of any particular scene due to the
generic fact that "those ever-springing
flowers and ever-flowing streams had been
dyed by the deep colours of human
endurance, valour, and virtue"? If
my theory is right that beauty is subjective,
not objective; that the connecting
link between the natural object and
the emotion which it evokes is that of
memory or association, surely we must
<a class="pagenum" name="page_167" title="167"> </a>
seek for a more particular, a more personal
explanation than this of Ruskin his
"human endurance, valour, and virtue."
Well, I too have lounged a whole morning
on a mountain top not far from the spot
of which Ruskin wrote. Before me was
the valley of the Arve; behind me, the
valley of the Rhône: both, from that
height of vision, and on that perfect day,
breathing prosperity and peace. Square
mile after square mile of fertile land lay
under my eyes: farms and vineyards,
fields and meadows, all watered by winding
streams. Dotted about, here in
groups, there discrete, were the tiled roofs
of cottages; and all through the verdure,
in long white curves with an occasional
tangent, here hidden by boscage, there
emerging in the sunlight, ran the good
white roads of France. The sweet grass
on which I lay was thickly strewn with
<a class="pagenum" name="page_168" title="168"> </a>
flowers, and the air brought scents sweet
as softest music heard afar. To right and
left in the middle distance rose Alpine
peaks&mdash;light green at their bases, dark
green in the zone of the pines, lifting grey
or green or purple masses towards the
clouds; and straight in front, some seven
leagues away, stretched the rugged jagged
snow-capped chain of Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>It was early morning, and it was one of
those perfect summer days when, as one
lay supine, one could actually perceive
the filmy clouds vanish into invisibility;
while, as an addition to the blessings of the
scene, there came to my ear the tinkling
bells of the cattle.</p>

<p>And the region was thick with the
memories of human endurance, valour,
and virtue. Cæsar's legions strode that
soil. Long before Cæsar came, marauding
<a class="pagenum" name="page_169" title="169"> </a>
bands had met and fought. And,
since Cæsar's time, owing to the fortunes
of war, war in which man fought hand-to-hand
with man&mdash;opposed shield to javelin,
discharged the feathered arrow, or
pointed arquebus and carronade&mdash;the
very ground on which I walked had
changed owners innumerable.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to choose a more
appealing scene.&mdash;And yet, if I probe
my own heart to the core, if I tell my
inmost thought, to me a sunny&mdash;or even,
for that matter, a misty&mdash;scene in pastoral
England&mdash;Surrey or Bucks or Berks,
Kent or Devon, Sussex or Herts, where
you will&mdash;rouses more poignant emotions
than all the plain of Haute Savoie backed
by the Chaine du Mont Blanc.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr Kipling, in his simple language, has
come nearer to the truth than has Ruskin
<a class="pagenum" name="page_170" title="170"> </a>
with all his felicity of phrase. It is not
the associations connected with human
endeavour <i>in the mass</i> that make any
particular scene to appeal, it is the associations
connected with our own little selves;
it is because "our hearts are small" that
God has</p>

<p>But, indeed, I think that the great
Darwin long ago, quite incidentally&mdash;and
quite unwittingly&mdash;put his finger upon
the crux of the problem. Speaking of
the beauties of the landscape of the East
Indian Archipelago he says: "These
scenes of the tropics are in themselves
so delicious, that they almost equal those
dearer ones at home, to which we are
<a class="pagenum" name="page_171" title="171"> </a>
bound by each best feeling of the mind."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"
href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The sublime and beautiful in Nature call
forth our admiration, reverence, awe;
it is the simple scenes, to which associations
cling, that call forth our love.</p>

<p>Nature&mdash;the sun, the sky, the earth,
the sea&mdash;is always beautiful, because
Nature, as Man's primæval habitat, has
embedded in the memory of Man primæval
associations; but for any one particular
scene to arouse emotions deeper than those
evoked by mere form and colour, that
scene must arouse associations embedded
in one's own memory or in those of one's
forbears. It may be that this is a
generalisation shallow and jejune. Yet
I make it, remembering torrid India;
wide Canadian snows; the Alps and
the Jura; the Rhône; the Rhine; the
Irawadi; lovely, lovable England; and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_172" title="172"> </a>
those perfumed slopes of le Grand Salève,
inhabited on that early morning only
by myself and those grazing cows.</p>

<h3>
§ 57</h3>

<p>Those mild-eyed cattle interested me.
They were very gentle, very sleek, very
quiet and patient; large of bone, lactiferous;
and, beneath all their passivity,
I should imagine they possessed potentialities
of heroism and endurance unknown
to their bovine fellows of the plains.
And if I may judge from the features,
figures, and expressions of the women of
this same region, too, I should be inclined
to conjecture that they were not dissimilar
in character to their kine. They too are
quiet-eyed, deep-bosomed, large-framed,
heavy-buttocked; and in the expression
of their faces there is something patient
and heroic. And the youthful tender of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_173" title="173"> </a>
those cattle&mdash;he too was interesting.
He lay prone on the grass, his back to
Mont Blanc. If he exercised his own
limbs but little, he faithfully performed
all the duties appertaining to that state of
life into which it had pleased God to call
him by springing every twenty minutes
to his feet and shouting orders to his dog&mdash;the
faithful sub or deputy herdsman,
who kept the cattle from straying too
far. I envied that youthful herdsman
his pleasant occupation. Life in that
mountain air must be sweet to the senses,
as companionship with those gentle kine
must be quieting to the mind.</p>

<h3>
§ 58</h3>

<p>It was a wonderful morning, that.
How quiet it was, how peaceful! Those
mighty mountains were so still, so soundless.
When I was out of sight of the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_174" title="174"> </a>
cattle, the only noise that reached my
ear was the hum of the bee at my elbow,
the song of the lark overhead. Nature
seemed at peace. Nature seemed to
fraternise with Man. A great comradeship
was abroad. With my own eyes I
saw three cows come to their keeper's side,
close up to him, and he, kind soul, stroked
their soft and wrinkled cheeks. With
my own eyes I saw a young and curious
heifer walk up to the recumbent dog&mdash;her
deputy-herdsman&mdash;and sniff his hide;
and he, good creature, never twitched
an ear!&mdash;though presently he did move
off, moving somewhat stiffly, as if his
dignity had been ruffled.</p>

<hr />

<p>And the flowers at my feet, on every
side! It was not grass I lay on; it was
blossoms&mdash;lovely scented blossoms; and
as I looked along the slopes it was flowers
<a class="pagenum" name="page_175" title="175"> </a>
I saw, not blades of grass: it was on a
purfled plain I lay, a plain of blue and
green and yellow and purple.&mdash;At first
I could hardly bring myself to crush these
buds. I kept to cart tracks, to cattle-paths.
But in time these ceased, and
I could not choose but crush. And
then ... came a curious thought; one
I hardly like to put on paper. Yet of
itself it came, and some perhaps will
interpret it as reverently as did I.&mdash;Nature
was in repentant mood, and, like
the Magdalen, was once again bedewing
Man's feet with her tears, and bescenting
them with her spikenard. She made
amends, as it were, for her treatment of
Man.&mdash;Fickle, feminine Nature, from
whose loins we come, from whose breast
we suck our livelihood; from whom we
wrest our pleasure&mdash;with much cost&mdash;much
cost and strife....</p>


<h3>
§ 59<a class="pagenum" name="page_176" title="176"> </a></h3>

<p>Strife! The very word was like a bell
to toll me back. Those very flowers were
fighting for their lives. Their very scents
and colours were but enticements for the
bee&mdash;for the bee which, in turn, with toil,
garnered honey against chimenal famine.
And those still, stupendous mountains&mdash;silent,
superb&mdash;immobile, massive; their
very crags bespoke tremendous struggle,
immense upheaval, and the grinding of
ice and glacier. Indeed the solid earth
and all about me was unrestful, rushing.&mdash;I
lay on my back on the grass and thrust
my finger towards the sky. It seemed
steady enough in all conscience. Yet I
knew that as a matter of fact that fingertip
of mine was performing most astounding
feats. It was rushing through space.
And in its rush it was pursuing a path
<a class="pagenum" name="page_177" title="177"> </a>
would take an expert astronomer to
determine. With the rotation of the
earth, it was flying eastwards at more
than a dozen miles a minute. With the
revolution of the earth, it was rushing
round the sun some two or three miles
in that minute. And with the whole
solar system, it was leaping towards the
constellation of Hercules with leaps of
more than seven hundred miles in each
minute!<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"
href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;Seven hundred miles a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_178" title="178"> </a>
minute!<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"
href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It is inconceivable. That
enormous mass, the sun, into a spot on
which, hundreds of our earths could be
dropped like a handful of pebbles into
a puddle, it and the farthermost of its
planets, three thousand million miles
away&mdash;all rushing through space ...
twenty miles while I sneeze; thirty
thousand miles while I sit at dinner; half-a-million
miles between going to bed and
getting up.... What a stupendous
journey! What a mighty company!
Where to? What for? Why this
terrific expenditure of energy?&mdash;Think
of the <i>ergs</i> necessary to propel that mass!
What is being <i>done</i>? Who does it?
And for whom?</p>

<p>Nothing is immobile in Nature.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_179" title="179"> </a>
Nothing is stationary in Life. To exist,
to be, to live, is to become, to change,
to strive, to achieve. The seeming peace
about me was outcome of infinite struggle.
Only by struggle does life evolve, does
man aspire.</p>

<span class="smcaps">Warnings to the Over-Zealous</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 60</h3>

<p>Now, I know precisely what will happen.
Some epimethean enthusiast, carried
away by the anticipated delights of a walk,
will suddenly make up his mind to take
one; will hastily stuff some things into
a bag, and will start off at four o'clock in
the morning with some vague and distant
goal in view. He will think to roll John
Burroughs and Richard Jefferies into one
in his minute observation of Nature, and
to outdo Wordsworth and Amiel combined
in his philosophico-poetical disquisitions
on the same; he will rid
his mind of the world and the worldly,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_181" title="181"> </a>
and float in themes transcendental and
abstruse. But I think I know what will
happen. By the afternoon of that selfsame
day he will be hungry, thirsty, footsore,
and tired. His boots will be tight;
his bag as heavy as his spirits; his head
as empty as his craw. Instead of observing
Nature he will find Nature&mdash;in the
shape of the rustics (and the rustics' dogs)&mdash;very
narrowly observing him, not
always with sympathetic or benignant
gaze. Instead of deep and transcendental
meditations rising spontaneously
to his mind, he will find curt and practical
questions assailing his ear as to who he is
and what he is doing there.&mdash;My dear but
epimethean enthusiast, you must know
that Nature is a jealous mistress. If so
be you are sedulously engaged for fifty
weeks in the year in the pursuit of pelf,
think not to woo her by a half day's
<a class="pagenum" name="page_182" title="182"> </a>
worship at her shrine. Even if your courtship
be sincere, it must be slow. Not in
forty-eight hours will you brush away
the cobwebs of the workaday world and
prepare for the reception of sweet Nature's
influence a mind free from all uncharitableness:
their skies, not their characters,
they change who sail over-seas. From
all blindness of heart, from pride, vainglory,
and hypocrisy, you must seek to
be delivered, else you will walk in vain.
For most men walk in a vain show, and
the perpetual perambulation of the streets
of Vanity Fair is a poor preparation for
the Delectable Mountains.&mdash;But take
heart. If you will keep but a corner of
your mind free from the carking cares of
barter and commerce&mdash;if only by half-holiday
jaunts and Sabbath-day journeys,
great will be your reward. By the end
of the third or fourth day's tramp, what
<a class="pagenum" name="page_183" title="183"> </a>
with the exhilarating exercise, the fresh
air, the peace and loneliness, the long
hours of mental quietude, the freedom
from the petty distractions of social and
official life, if you are humble and childlike,
the world forgetting by the world
forgot&mdash;the scales will fall from your
eyes; then indeed you will see&mdash;and feel&mdash;and
think. The trivial little objects
at your feet, equally with the immense
expanses of earth and sky, will lift you
high above themselves; the wet and
drooping high-road weed, the tender
green of a curled frond, the soft ooziness
of a summer marsh&mdash;the sense of beauty&mdash;of
the fitness of things&mdash;of their immense
incomprehensibility&mdash;the wonder
of it all ... words seem useless to say
how such things sink into the soul, plough
up its foundations, sow there seeds which,
like the Indian juggler's plant, spring
<a class="pagenum" name="page_184" title="184"> </a>
up at once and blossom into worship,
reverence, awe.&mdash;Believe me, I am not
extravagant or hyperbolic, nor do I beguile
with empty words. If you will not hear
me, hear the simple-minded Richard
Jefferies:</p>

<p>"I linger in the midst of the long grass,
the luxury of the leaves, and the song in
the very air. I seem as if I could feel all
the glowing life the sunshine gives and the
south wind calls to being. The endless
grass, the endless leaves, the immense
strength of the oak expanding, the unalloyed
joy of finch and blackbird; from
all of them I receive a little.... In the
blackbird's melody one note is mine; in
the dance of the leaf shadows the formed
maze is for me, though the motion is
theirs; the flowers with a thousand faces
have collected the kisses of the morning.
Feeling with them, I receive some, at
least, of their fulness of life. Never
could I have enough; never stay long
<a class="pagenum" name="page_185" title="185"> </a>
enough.... The hours when the mind
is absorbed by beauty are the only hours
when we really live, so that the longer we
can stay among these things so much the
more is snatched from inevitable Time....
These are the only hours that are not
wasted&mdash;these hours that absorb the soul
and fill it with beauty. This is real life,
and all else is illusion, or mere endurance.
To be beautiful and to be calm, without
mental fear, is the ideal of Nature. If I
cannot achieve it, at least I can think
it."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"
href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Which passage has received the <i>imprimatur</i>
of quotation by no less an authority
than Lord Avebury (better known, perhaps,
as Sir John Lubbock), himself not
only a man of science, but a statesman
and a man of affairs as well. Listen:</p>

<p>"The exquisite beauty and delight of a
fine summer day in the country has never
<a class="pagenum" name="page_186" title="186"> </a>
perhaps been more truly, and therefore
more beautifully, described."<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>But surely, with all deference to the
learned quoter, there is something deeper
in Richard Jefferies, these his dithyrambs,
than a description of a fine summer day.
Surely Jefferies finds himself here, in
Amiel's fine phrase, <i>tête-à-tête</i> with the
Infinite, and tries, poor soul, in vain to
find vent for his thoughts. It is not a
picture, it is a poem. Nor needed it
the Pageant of Summer to transport this
poet thither. Jefferies was here viewing
Nature through a seventh sense&mdash;a sense
more delicate than that of sight or sound,
the sense that Maurice de Guérin has
defined as,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Un sens que nous avons tous, mais
voilé, vague, et privé presque de toute
<a class="pagenum" name="page_187" title="187"> </a>
activité, le sens qui recueille les beautés
physiques et les livre à l'âme, qui les
spiritualise, les harmonie, les combine
avec les beautés idéales, et agrandit ainsi
sa sphère d'amour et d'adoration"<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"
href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>It is not Richard Jefferies his catalogue
of the things he saw which moves us to
admiration and delight, it is his sense
sublime which enabled him to rise from
the things which are seen to the things
which are unseen, to rise above the <i>hic et
nunc</i> of the parochial and to peer into the
<i>illuc et tunc</i> of the eternal. He saw
"into the life of things," and in him the
finite stirred emotions which savoured of
the infinite.</p>

<span class="smcaps">How that all points to the Infinite</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 61</h3>

<p>Of a sober truth, could we only realise
it, all things point to the infinite. Not a
cobweb, not a wisp of morning mist, not
a toadstool, not a gnat, but has a life-history
dating back to the dark womb
of Time, or ere even meteoritic dust or
incandescent nebulæ were born; dating
forward too, could we trace it, to the dark
doom of Time, if for Time there be a doom.
Who can understand it? Who shall
explain it?&mdash;any part of it? Take
Burns his simple line,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poemcenter">
"Green grow the rashes, O."</p>

<p>To explain "green" is not within the
power of profoundest oculist and physicist
<a class="pagenum" name="page_189" title="189"> </a>
combined: on the question of the colour-sense
alone the scientific world is divided
and has for years been divided; and of
the precise action of chlorophyll&mdash;the
green colouring-matter of plants&mdash;it is
almost equally ignorant; while of the
train of connected phænomena, from the
chemic and catalytic action in the leaf,
through the stimulation of the retina, the
transmission along the optic nerve, the
sensation in the corpora quadrigemina of
the brain, to the concept in the mind, we
know absolutely nothing. To define and
classify the rushes, also; to know exactly
their place in the vegetable kingdom and
how they came there&mdash;their evolution
from lower forms, the modifications
wrought in their structure by environment
and internecine strife&mdash;that is
beyond the wit of botanist and palæophytologist
in one. And as to that simple
<a class="pagenum" name="page_190" title="190"> </a>
verb, "to grow," dealing, as it does, with
life itself in its inmost penetralia, that has
baffled, and probably will for ever baffle,
the whole host of physical and metaphysical
experimenters and speculators world
without end. When we can explain Life,
we shall be within measurable distance
of explaining the Life-Giver.&mdash;Tennyson

<h3>
§ 62</h3>

<p>But my song has grown too advent'rous.
Let us descend th'Aonian mount.&mdash;This,
however, let me say: If to somewhat
abstruse ontological speculations such as
these you like to add scientific or other
knowledge of the region of your walk&mdash;something
<a class="pagenum" name="page_191" title="191"> </a>
of the geology, palæontology,
mineralogy, zoology, botany, archæology,
history, well and good. No sort of knowledge
but is profitable for doctrine. The
interest and pleasure of walking are
greatly enhanced by noting and being
able to account for the thousand and one
natural phænomena which greet the eye
even in the shortest stroll; and few
things sooner oust petty worries from the
mind than such occupation. Happy is
the man who can do this. I, alas, cannot
help you here. I have but a bowing
acquaintance with Science, though it is
always with a deep reverence that I doff
my hat to her. Nevertheless, with this
I console myself; it seems to matter but
little with what sort of eyes you look on
Nature, provided you really look. Give
her but the seeing eye and the understanding
heart, and she is lavish of her
<a class="pagenum" name="page_192" title="192"> </a>
gifts.&mdash;And (let me roun this in thine ear)
perhaps she prefers (woman-like) the
understanding heart to the seeing eye;
though (woman-like again) she likes to be
admired as well as understood&mdash;though
never (and here most woman-like) does
she like to be too curiously regarded.&mdash;Sometimes,
I confess, I have envied him
gifted with the scientific eye: him in
whom a granite boulder in a grassy mead
rouses long geological trains of thought;
to whom the dwarfed horse-tails by lacustrine
shores paint pictures of dense
equisetaceous forests; for whom a fossil
trilobite calls up visions of Silurian seas;
him too have I envied who can classify
common plants or recognise and name the
stones at his feet: can tell us why the
lowly daisy is superior to the lordly oak;
can expatiate on crystallographic angles;
and learnedly descant on amphibole or
<a class="pagenum" name="page_193" title="193"> </a>
pyroxene. For myself, I am not versed
in the mechanism of Nature. I have
never asked to see the wheels go round.
I like to see her smile, and am not careful
as to what oral or buccal muscles are
brought into play for that smile. That
she has an anatomy I suppose. But I
bethink me of Actæon's fate, he who saw
Dian's naked loveliness too near. So
thou, beware lest thine eye see so much
that thy heart understand too little.
Keep thy mind "in a just equipoise of
love." Accomplish that, and no knowledge
is too high for thee.</p>

<h3>
§ 63</h3>

<p>Here, however, it is but right to enter
a <i>caveat</i>. It must be admitted that it is
not given to everyone to hold high
converse with Nature. Nature speaks a
cryptic tongue, and unless one has paid
<a class="pagenum" name="page_194" title="194"> </a>
some heed to her language her accents are
apt to fall upon deaf ears. Nor can anyone
translate Nature's language to those
unversed in her speech. If you think
to hear her voice while the din and clatter
of business or mercature are ringing in
your ears, you will hear nothing. Nor,
for that matter, will you see anything.
Trees and fields and clouds you may see,
or may think you see; but they will say
nothing to you, will mean nothing to you.
To their mere beauty you will be blind;
for beauty is a thing to be felt, not
seen.</p>

<p>Beauty is <i>felt</i>. That is the clue to the
secret. The appeal of natural beauty is
to the heart, to the emotions, not to the
intellect. The eyes of the wisest savant
may miss what Nature will reveal to the
veriest babe. This is what Mr Edward
Carpenter means when he says, albeit in
somewhat extravagant language&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to you, O Moon&mdash;</p>

never so carefully they do not see you
personal and close&mdash;</p>

created things you do not yield yourself

<span class="smcaps">The Pleasures of Walking</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 64</h3>

<p>"But what possible pleasure, what
possible profit," I can hear the practical
and common-sensible man asking, "is
to be gained from walking&mdash;<i>walking</i>?
Surely walking is the paltriest of sports.
Why not write of riding, driving, rowing,
bicycling, motoring, aeroplaning&mdash;any
mode of locomotion rather than that of
mere trudging?"&mdash;Well, in a technical
and paronomasiacal phrase, the question
really <i>solvitur ambulando</i>. For one thing,
horses have to be baited, boats caulked,
bicycles pumped up, balloons inflated,
and motor cars eternally tinkered at&mdash;aeroplanes
<a class="pagenum" name="page_199" title="199"> </a>
fly far beyond my welkin.
For another thing, not the least of the
practical blessings incident to a walk is
that you are beyond the reach of letters
and telegrams and telephones. You are
not likely to be served with a writ when
walking; you can laugh at <i>capiases</i> and
injunctions; drafts at sight and judgment
summonses cannot easily overtake you on
a trudge. "I have generally found,"
says De Quincey, "that, if you are in
quest of some certain escape from Philistines
of whatsoever class&mdash;sheriff-officers,
bores, no matter what&mdash;the surest refuge
is to be found amongst hedgerows and
fields."<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"
href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> (Had De Quincey lived in the
twentieth century, truly he might have
added that it is amongst the fields and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_200" title="200"> </a>
hedgerows also that one gets away from
that pest of civilisation, the pene-ubiquitous
advertisement.&mdash;And not always even
amongst fields and hedgerows, as the
landscape-spoiling hoardings along the
routes of our railways prove. Like Nero,
I sometimes wish that the erectors of sky-signs
and the daubers of barns and fences
had but one neck that I might ... that
I might&mdash;lay upon it a heavy yoke of
taxation.&mdash;I throw out that hint to
any Finance Minister or Chancellor of the
Exchequer that may care to act upon it.)</p>

<p>But far rather would I reply to my
quærist in other words than mine.&mdash;"I
went to the woods," says Thoreau, "because
I wished to live deliberately, to
front only the essential facts of life....
I wanted to live deep and suck out all
the marrow of life.... Our life is frittered
away by detail.... In the midst of this
<a class="pagenum" name="page_201" title="201"> </a>
chopping sea of civilised life, such are
the clouds and storms and quicksands and
thousand and one items to be allowed for
that a man has to live, if he would not
founder and go to the bottom and not
make his port at all, by dead reckoning,
he must be a great calculator indeed who
succeeds."<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Hear, too, Henri-Frédéric Amiel:</p>

<p>"<i>1st February 1854.</i>&mdash;A walk. The
atmosphere incredibly pure&mdash;a warm,
caressing gentleness in the sunshine&mdash;joy
in one's whole being.... I became
young again, wondering, and simple, as
candour and ignorance are simple. I
abandoned myself to life and to nature,
and they cradled me with an infinite
gentleness. To open one's heart in purity
to this ever-pure nature, to allow this
immortal life of things to penetrate into
<a class="pagenum" name="page_202" title="202"> </a>
one's soul, is at the same time to listen
to the voice of God. Sensation may be a
prayer, and self-abandonment an act of
devotion."<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"
href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
</p>

<p>Or hear a greater man than these&mdash;hear
the great Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
he who divided with Voltaire the intellectual
realm of the eighteenth century:</p>

<p>"What I regret most in the details of
my life which I have forgotten is that
I did not keep a diary of my travels.
Never have I thought so much, never have
I realised my own existence so much, been
so much alive, been so much myself if I
may so say, as in those journeys which
I have made alone and afoot. Walking
has something in it which animates and
heightens my ideas: I can scarcely think
when I stay in one place; my body must
be set a-going if my mind is to work.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_203" title="203"> </a>
The sight of the country, the succession
of beautiful scenes, the great breeze, the
good appetite, the health which I gain by
walking, the getting away from inns, the
escape from everything which reminds me
of my lack of independence, from everything
which reminds me of my unlucky
fate&mdash;all this releases my soul, gives me
greater courage of thought, throws me as
it were into the midst of the immensity of
the objects of Nature, which I may combine,
from which I may choose at will,
which I may make my own carelessly and
without fear. I make use of all Nature
as her master; my heart, surveying one
object after another, unites itself, identifies
itself with those in sympathy with it,
surrounds itself with delightful images,
intoxicates itself with emotions the most
exquisite. If, in order to seize these, I
amuse myself by describing them to
myself, what a vigorous pencil, what bright
colours, what energy of expression they
need! Some have, so they say, discerned
something of these influences in my writings,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_204" title="204"> </a>
though composed in my declining
years. Ah! if only those of my early
youth had been seen! those which I have
composed but never written down!"<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"
href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
</p>

<p>Thus wrote the great Jean-Jacques in
the calm of his declining years. Those
walking inspirations must have been
potent indeed to have left so lasting an
impression.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"
href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<h3>
§ 65</h3>

<p>But Thoreau and Amiel and Jean-Jacques
Rousseau are perhaps counsellors
of perfection; exemplars too remote for
our purpose. Permit me then to resort
to an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.&mdash;I knew a
man who one summer tried to do two and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_205" title="205"> </a>
a half men's work in one. For five days
in the week it took him from early in
the morning of one day till early in
the morning of the next. On Saturday
afternoon he was free, and on Saturday
he took the boat to a village twenty-one
miles distant. Sunday afternoon was
devoted (alas, necessarily) again to work,&mdash;but
in the open air. At two-thirty on
Monday morning he started on his return
journey&mdash;afoot; breakfasted halfway in;
and was at his desk in as good time as
spirits.&mdash;Profit? That early morning
walk picked him up for the week.
Pleasure? My dear practical sir, would
you had been with him! Would you had
felt the quiet, the serenity, the calming
influence of unsullied Nature; the
supreme repose in those early morning
hours, the solitude, the vastness, the
expansion of soul and spirit beneath the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_206" title="206"> </a>
silent stars, the quiet morn. He saw the
full moon pale and set; he saw great
Nature slowly wake; the sleepy cows
knee-deep in clover; the fields begemmed
with dew; the little pools&mdash;pools which at
noon would be muddy puddles&mdash;glistening
like emeralds and garnets in the dawn. By
degrees, growing things were individualised.
Each shrub, each creeping thing,
had a life of its own. The veriest weed
was exalted into a vegetable personality
which had dealings with the Infinite and
the Divine: and "all flowers in field or
forest which unclose their trembling eyelids
to the kiss of day" spake to him.&mdash;He
was alone&mdash;alone with unhurrying,
uncareful Nature. The peace of untold
æons entered his soul and couraged him
to battle with the petty and the trivial
for five more wearing days without a
qualm.&mdash;Profit? Pleasure?&mdash;What nag,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_207" title="207"> </a>
what buggy, what skiff, what bike, what
motor, what dirigible balloon, or hydro-aeroplane
would have got him that? In
simple truth, of all that he learned and
did during those arduous weeks, only
those lovely lonely walks live in that
man's memory to-day.&mdash;Would that
oftener we bathed our thirsty souls in the
dews of the dawn! Would that oftener
men gat them away from offices and
counters and desks&mdash;nay, from balls and
bats and cleeks&mdash;away into the quiet
country, where nor strife nor struggle,
noble or ignoble, has place or worth!
The world is too much with us. Call-loans&mdash;narrow
margins, with a slump in
the market&mdash;killing races with a dark
horse&mdash;quickly changing quotations&mdash;prolonged
ill luck&mdash;unstable tariffs&mdash;strikes
and rumours of strikes&mdash;such
things perturb the human mind. Well,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_208" title="208"> </a>
I know few more efficacious antidotes
to mental perturbation than an early
morning walk. It is a psychic as well
as a sanitary investment.</p>

<h3>
§ 66</h3>

<p>It is also a mental tonic&mdash;even in
hom&oelig;opathic doses.&mdash;I took last Sunday
a little four-mile stroll before breakfast,
and its calming and beneficent influence
is with me still. No one was about; I
had the whole country to myself, and
I bathed a tired head in the spacious
quietude of earth and sky. From a
height I looked over a great and restful
country, across the sleeping town, and far
away over the peaceful lake. Above it
all stretched the benevolent heavens,
brooding over this pendent world.&mdash;I
thought I saw fixity in the midst of
motion; substance beneath evanescence;
<a class="pagenum" name="page_209" title="209"> </a>
unity in multiplicity; a sort of goal where
everything was cyclical; an end where
all things seemed only means; infinity
lurking in finitude; a divine inhering
in the human. After the treadmill of
the week it was uplifting, exalting. I
inhaled great draughts of air from ultra-planetary
spaces; I fed on manna fallen
from the highest heavens. This tiny
planet, with its trivial cares and duties,
vanished from my eyes, and I cooled my
brow in the clouds of the holy of holies.&mdash;But
none the less did I recognise the all-importance,
to it and to me, of earth's
small cares and duties. Were they not
part of that infinite multiplicity in which
lurked that infinite unity? Did they not
go to make up the "spiritual economy"<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"
href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
<a class="pagenum" name="page_210" title="210"> </a>
of the cosmos? But I saw them in a
newer light&mdash;a larger light than merely
solar, and they took on a new aspect, and
declared themselves integral portions of
that divine All without which that divine
All would cease to be.</p>

<p>There is something strangely pure and
purifying about early morning air. It is
Nature's great steriliser. It is aseptic;
and none breathes it but is more or less
cleansed of the taint of noontide life.
The noxious germs of care and anxiety
cannot live in it. It is a magnificent
bactericide. Nature is herself then.
Even the denizens of Nature seem to
know this, for never is bird or beast
more blithesome than at dawn.</p>

<h3>
§ 67</h3>

<p>For lonely souls, for luckless souls,
there is, perhaps, after all is said and done,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_211" title="211"> </a>
but one source of solace. "Nothing
human," said Eugénie de Guérin, "nothing
human comforts the soul, nothing
human supports it:&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent0">Well, those who think their God has
revealed himself in the Canonical Books
will go to their Bible; those who think
he has chosen the channel of a Church
will derive ghostly strength from their
spiritual counsellors; but those who
think the Nameless has nowhere so plainly
shown himself as in his works, will seek
in the face and lineaments of Nature that
consoling smile which every lonely soul
so miserably craves; and fortunate it is
that not over his works, but only over his
<a class="pagenum" name="page_212" title="212"> </a>
words, theologians so wrathfully wrangle.&mdash;Art
thou cast down, and is thy soul
disquieted within thee? Dost distrust
thyself? Has love grown cold? And
hast thou caught on thy leman's lips a
sigh not meant for thee? Is there none
to whom thou canst go, on whose bosom
to rain out the heavy mist of tears?&mdash;Go
thou to Pan; betake thee to the fields;
betake thee to the woods; pour out thy
contrite heart at the altar of the universe,
and thou shalt be comforted. What
matters it the petty perturbations of
the mind? What signify the paltry
upheavings of the heart? Lay thy tired
head on Nature's breast. Friendship
may fade, ideals vanish, passion wane,
the darling desire upon which thou hast
staked thine all may prove to have been
snatched from thee before thy very eyes.&mdash;Take
heart. Always there is at hand
<a class="pagenum" name="page_213" title="213"> </a>
the Infinite and the Eternal: about thee,
above thee, in presence of which the petty
and the paltry flee away.</p>

<p>I know no more comfortable medicament
than the quiet companionship of
Nature. The trees breathe a salutary air.
The fields invite to repose. A calming
influence pervades unwalled, unceilinged
earth, and there the crumpled soul has
room in which to smooth itself out: the
noxious bacilli which infest its folds are
swept away; ill-natured thoughts take
flight. How paltry seems a passing
quarrel beneath the boughs of a hoary
oak that has witnessed a hundred fights!
How puny a callous rage beneath the
capacious sky!</p>

<p>For, believe me, Great Pan is <i>not</i> dead.
Nor, believe me, are any that go to him
in any wise cast out. He cares not of what
Church thou art a child, nor does he fence
<a class="pagenum" name="page_214" title="214"> </a>
his tables. Worship at whatsoever shrine
thou choosest, always he will welcome
thee to his, for Pan is beloved of all the
gods.</p>

<p>Ach! There comes a time when
nothing seems worth while; when gaiety
palls, and even sorrow dulls instead of
stirs; when nothing seems of any use, and
one feels inclined to give up, to give up.&mdash;To
such I would say, pull on thick boots,
clutch a stout stick, and go for a country
walk&mdash;rain or shine.&mdash;It sounds a preposterous
remedy, but try it. Nature
never gives up. Not a pygmy weed,
trodden under foot of man, and covered
up and overwhelmed with rival growths,
but battles for its life with vim. Nor
does it ask for what it battles. Neither
does it question why more favoured plants
are so carefully nurtured, and it, poor
thing, is dragged up by the roots.&mdash;Take
<a class="pagenum" name="page_215" title="215"> </a>
a country walk, and look at the weeds if
at nothing else.</p>

<p>And remember, this is a legitimate remedy,
preposterous though it may sound.
So many prescriptions for the heartache
are illegitimate&mdash;stimulants, or narcotics,
or stimulant-narcotics: sport, work,
play, hazardous adventure, the gaming-table
or the betting-ring, to say nothing
of the cup that inebriates but does not
cheer. A country walk is but "letting
Nature have her way," is but giving
an opportunity for the <i>vis medicatrix
naturæ</i>. Try it; do not, like Naaman,
prate of Abana and Pharpar, rivers of
Damascus, but go wash in Jordan seven
times.</p>



<h2>
XXVII<a class="pagenum" name="page_216" title="216"> </a><br/>
<span class="smcaps">Is Walking Selfish?</span></h2>

<h3>
§ 68</h3>

<p>But is it not a selfish pleasure, this that
is to be gained by rural peregrination,
I shall be asked. Bluntly I answer, No.
A country walk makes one blithesome;
and than blithesomeness there is no
greater foe to selfishness. Had Bacon
not declared that gardening was the
purest of human pleasures, I should be
inclined to give the palm to walking.</p>

<p>We are too gregarious. We live too
much in herds, and we consider too much
what the herd will think of our petty
individual ways. Civilisation is not an
unmixed boon, and artificial combinations
<a class="pagenum" name="page_217" title="217"> </a>
of men taint the natural simplicity of the
race. In combining together for mutual
protection against a common foe we
forget that sometimes a man's foes are
those of his own household. Each feels
that the eyes of the world are upon him,
and always he is subconsciously occupied
in conforming himself to the world. A
political community not only curtails
the individual's freedom of action for
the good of the whole, it curtails also
his freedom of thought and manner.
What is the result? The result is that
"self-consciousness" has taken on a
new and sinister meaning. Instead of
denoting the especial and distinguishing
characteristic of emancipated reason, self-consciousness
has come to denote a painful
cognisance of the fetters that our fellow-reasoners
have put upon reason. We are
the slaves of ourselves. Only the child
<a class="pagenum" name="page_218" title="218"> </a>
and the savage are free to "live deliberately,"
to "live deep and suck out all the
marrow of life." Long before the child
has developed into the grown, and the
savage into the civilised, man, that silent
and unseen but tireless architect, Convention,
builds about him an invisible but
infrangible wall of reserve: his spontaneous
emotions, his natural affections, his
aspirations and ambitions, must filter
through crevices and peepholes instead
of exhaling from him as a rich and original
aura.</p>

<p>Already the taint is perceptible in our
literature. The centripetal tendency is
not a purely economic one. Commerce
and industry draw the crowds to the
cities, and immediately there arises a set
of writers who write only of the city.
How large a proportion of our fiction
portrays only the wretched drawing-room
<a class="pagenum" name="page_219" title="219"> </a>
intrigue, the wretched rivalries of
wretched citizens. The Epic was buried
three hundred years ago. The Ode is
dead. The Lyric is dying. Now we have
the Novel and the Problem Play, the
sensational Newspaper and the Picture
Magazine. In time, I suppose, we shall
come to the Snapshot and the Paperette.
Already we are almost there.&mdash;Was it for
this that the mighty Areopagitical pleader
for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing
strove?</p>

<p>I wish that whole populations of crowded
cities could be turned out hebdomadally
to take long week-end walks in the
country, there to mew its mighty youth
and kindle its undazzled eyes at the full
midday beam; there to slough off the
skin of daily toil, cleanse itself from the
dross of money-getting, and learn that
there is something in life more worth
<a class="pagenum" name="page_220" title="220"> </a>
living for than the weekly wage, and other
joys than those of <i>panem et circenses</i>.&mdash;But
this is a wild dream. As well try to
rehabilitate the Bacchic dance and Chian
wine in place of Football and beer or
Baseball and peanuts.&mdash;Yet methinks
I have heard of wilder. What did Jean-Jacques
and his school really mean by
"back to nature"?</p>

<p>To me, I confess, this polipetal or city-seeking
tendency in modern life (if I may
so call it) wears a most serious, a most
sinister aspect. So, I am inclined to think,
it did to Ruskin. "I had once purposed,"
wrote John Ruskin half-a-century ago,
"to show what kind of evidence existed
respecting the possible influence of country
life on men; it seeming to me, then, likely
that here and there a reader would perceive
this to be a grave question, more than
most which we contend about, political
<a class="pagenum" name="page_221" title="221"> </a>
or social, and might care to follow it out
with me earnestly. The day will assuredly
come when men will see that it <i>is</i> a grave
question."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"
href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>If we read history aright, always the
bloated city succumbs to the pagan horde.
It is in the crowded city that all that is
in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the
lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"
href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> have
most free play. And it is in the city,
where division of labour is daily carried
to greater extremes, that men's activities
as a whole have least free play. The
result is twofold: the nobler emotions
are stunted; the baser passions are
stimulated. Socialism (whatever the
precise prescription so labelled may be)
<a class="pagenum" name="page_222" title="222"> </a>
is no remedy for this. Perhaps Rousseau
reasoned better than he knew.</p>

<p>In a sense, however&mdash;thanks to whatever
gods may be!&mdash;as a matter of fact
there is quietly going on a constant
recurrence to Nature. The United States
of America, Canada, Australia, South
Africa&mdash;what but wholesale emigration
from over-populous or over-pragmatical

Colonisation is the protest against the
social, political, economical, or religious
constrictions of the crowd.&mdash;It is precisely
these constrictions, my practical
quærist, that I am tempting thee now

<h3>
§ 69</h3>

<p>Have I too much belauded the country
walk? I do not thereby decry the outdoor
sport. The thorough sportsman is
the noblest work of God (apologies to the
shade of Alexander Pope!). Athletics,
said that acute philosophical historian,
Goldwin Smith, "wash the brain." Well,
sometimes I think a really good country
walk cleans the soul. You get away from
rivalries and trivialities; from scandal,
gossip, and paltriness; you get away
from your compeers and your neighbours&mdash;perhaps
you learn for the first time who
your neighbour is&mdash;namely, your fellow-farer
<a class="pagenum" name="page_224" title="224"> </a>
in distress, as the Good Samaritan
long ago taught; you get away from
barter and commerce, from manners and
customs, from forms and ceremonies;
from the thousand and one complications
that arise when a multitude of hearts that
do not beat as one try to live in a too
close contiguity. It was only when the
inevitable third party appeared upon the
scene (as I think someone must have
said) that Adam and Eve ceased to be
good, put on clothes, and hid themselves
from the voice of the Lord God walking
in the garden. It is easy to be generous
amongst trees and grass and running
water; one feels good 'neath the blue
firmament on the open earth; ghosts
vanish that scent the morning air, and
glow-worms pale their uneffectual fire.
For to everyone&mdash;I care not whether
theist, deist, or atheist&mdash;to everyone
<a class="pagenum" name="page_225" title="225"> </a>
Nature instinctively, spontaneously,
proclaims herself an infinitely adorable
Mystery. If there is anything above and
beyond the ephemeral and the fleeting;
if there is somewhere some immensity of
Being, some source of All, would it not be
well sometimes to make haste and bow the
head towards the earth and worship?<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"
href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Some immensity of Being. It is to this
that in reality all Nature points. The
clouds, the skies, the greenery of earth, the
myriad forms of vegetation at our feet,
stir as these may the soul to its depths,
they are but single chords in the orchestra
of Life. It is the great pæan of Being
that Nature chants. By them it is that
we perceive "the immense circulation of
life which throbs in the ample bosom of
Nature, a life which surges from an
invisible source and swells the veins of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_226" title="226"> </a>
this universe."<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"
href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Through them it is
that we detect the enormous but incomprehensible
unity which underlies
this incommensurable multiplicity. The
wavelet's plash; the purl of the rill; the
sough of the wind in the pines&mdash;these are
but notes in the divine diapason of Life,
of Life singing its cosmic song, unmindful
who may hear.&mdash;Alas, that so few hear
aught but a thin and scrannel sound!</p>

curve described by my finger nail was, especially
if to rotation, revolution, and the approach
